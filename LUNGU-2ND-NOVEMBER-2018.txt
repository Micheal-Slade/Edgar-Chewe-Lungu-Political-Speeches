GOOD MORNING. 
IT IS WITH GREAT PLEASURE THAT I JOIN YOU ALL IN 
CELEBRATING THIS IMPORTANT MILESTONE OF PROVIDING 
CLEAN AND SAFE WATER TO THE RESIDENTS OF JACK 
COMPOUND. 
1 
I VISITED THIS AREA IN 2016 WHEN THE WORKS ON THE 
PROJECT WERE COMMENCING AND I HAVE BEEN AWARE OF 
THE CHALLENGES THAT MOST OF OUR RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN 
FACING IN ACCESSING CLEAN AND SAFE WATER. 
I AM THEREFORE VERY PLEASED THAT THE MILLENNIUM 
CHALLENGE ACCOUNT-ZAMBIA, HAS DELIVERED ON ITS 
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY TO THE 
PEOPLE OF JACK TOWNSHIP. 
ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF THE 
REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA, I WISH TO SINCERELY THANK THE PEOPLE 
AND GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (USA) 
FOR THIS LIFE-SAVING SUPPORT. 
ZAMBIA AND THE UNITED STATE OF AMERICA HAVE 
CONTINUED TO ENJOY A CORDIAL BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP 
FOR MANY DECADES. 
THE US$355 MILLION GRANT WHICH HAS DELIVERED THIS 
PROJECT IS ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES OF TREMENDOUS 
SUPPORT RECEIVED FROM THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. 
2 
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, 
THIS PROJECT REPRESNTS THE CLEAREST DEMONSTRATION 
OF THE GREAT FRIEDSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO PEOPLES OF 
ZAMBIA AND THE UNITED STATES. 
THE LUSAKA WATER SUPPLY, SANITATION AND DRAINAGE 
PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR THE LAST FIVE (5) 
YEARS WILL DIRECTLY IMPROVE THE LIVES OF OVER 1.2 MILLION 
RESIDENTS OF THE CITY OF LUSAKA. 
THIS LANDMARK PROJECT WILL FOREVER REMAIN AN 
ICONIC SYMBOL OF SUPPORT FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EMPHASIZE TO YOUR 
EXCELLENCY AMBASSADOR FOOTE, THAT THOSE WHO SEEK TO 
UNDERMINE THE GREAT FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN ZAMBIA AND THE 
USA, MUST COME HERE TO JACK TOWNSHIP, SEE FOR 
THEMSELVES THE THINGS THAT MATTER IN OUR RELATIONSHIP. 
WHEN SAY THIS, I SPEAK FOR BOTH GOVERNMENTS, THAT, 
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS GUIDED BY A SHARED COMMITMENT 
TOWARDS THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE LIVELIHOODS OF OUR 
PEOPLE. 
3 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, 
I HAVE SAID IN RECENT PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT I WILL 
NOT WASTE TIME ON UNCONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM THAT SEEKS 
TO TO PARALYSE GOVERNMENT INTO INACTION. 
BUT IT IS OPPORTUNE MOMENTS LIKE THIS GREAT 
CEREMONY, WE SEE IT FIT TO TELL OUR OWN STORIES TO 
CORRECT THE DISTORTIONS THAT ARE BEEN SPLASHED IN 
LOCAL AND FOREIGN MEDIA TO POISON RELATIONS WITH OUR 
FRIENDS; TO HARM OUR ECONOMY, AND THE COUNTRY AT 
LARGE. 
BUT GET IT FROM ME, WHEN ALL THAT NOISE HAS 
SUBSIDED, YOU WILL ALWAYS HEAR FROM US THE MESSAGE OF 
HOPE; THE MESSAGE OF DEVELOPMENT THAT SEEKS TO UPLIFT 
THE LIVES OF OUR PEOPLE OUT OF POVERT AS THE PROJECT IS 
DOING. 
AGAIN, WE SAY MANY THANKS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES FOR THIS HELP THAT IS VISIBLY 
TRANSFORMING THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILE OF 1.2 
MILLION PEOPLE IN THE GREATER CITY OF LUSAKA. 
4 
WE ARE GREATFUL TOO, FOR THE MANY OTHER INITIATIVES 
BEING FINANCED BY THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT 
INCLUDING THOSE IN THE HEALTH SECTOR SUCH AS THE UNITED 
STATES PRESIDENT’S EMERGENCY PLAN FOR AIDS RELIEF 
(PEPFAR). 
THIS INITIATIVE HAS PROVIDED ON AVERAGE, OVER 
US$300 MILLION TO ZAMBIA ANNUALLY SINCE 2004. 
MADAME VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE MILLENNIUM 
CHALLENGE CORPORATION, AND YOUR EXCELLENCY THE 
AMERICAN AMBASSADOR TO ZAMBIA, KINDLY CONVEY OUR 
SINCERE GRATITUDE TO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. DONALD TRUMP 
AND THE GENEROUS PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA FOR THESE GENEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS. 
WHEN WATER IS SCARCE, THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE 
LIVES OF PEOPLE IS DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE. FOR EXAMPLE, 
CHILDREN ARE UNABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE TO DRAW WATER FROM DISTANT PLACES OR THEY ARE 
SUFFERING FROM WATER-BORNE DISEASES SUCH AS DYSENTERY 
OR CHOLERA. 
5 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, 
THE TIME SAVED IN DRAWING WATER FROM NEARBY 
PROTECTED WATER SOURCES WILL ENABLE OUR PEOPLE TO 
ENGAGE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES THAT WILL INCREASE 
HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC 
GROWTH. 
ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER SUPPLY AND ADEQUATE 
SANITATION BY EVERYONE IS A KEY ASPECT OF SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT. 
NO COUNTRY CAN ATTAIN ITS DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 
WITHOUT HARNESSING THIS PRIMARY RESOURCE. WATER 
SUPPLY AND SANITATION IS CRITICAL FOR ALL SECTORS IN THE 
ECONOMY TO ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY. 
IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT MY GOVERNMENT HAS 
PRIORITISED PROVISION OF CLEAN AND SAFE WATER IN THE 7TH 
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND VISION 2030. 
BY 2030, EVERY ZAMBIAN WILL HAVE ACCESS TO RELIABLE, 
CLEAN AND SAFE WATER SUPPLY AND ADEQUATE SANITATION. 
6 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, 
THEREFORE, TODAY’S CEREMONY IS NOT ONLY 
IMPORTANT FOR RESIDENTS OF JACK COMPOUND BUT FOR THE 
ENTIRE COUNTRY AS WE BRING TO FRUITION MY 
GOVERNMENT’S VISION OF ENSURING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO 
CLEAN AND SAFE WATER. 
OVER 30,000 PEOPLE WILL BENEFIT FROM THE JACK 
COMPOUND WATER SUPPLY INTERVENTION. 
RESIDENTS OF JACK TOWNSHIP, WAKE UP AS EARLY AS 
04:00 HOURS TO LINE UP FOR WATER. IN MOST CASES, THEY 
PLACE DRUMS IN THE QUEUE AS THEY WAIT TO DRAW WATER AT 
06:00 HOURS. 
I AM DELIGHTED THAT WITH THIS INTERVENTION, THE 
RESIDENTS OF JACK COMPOUND WILL FORGET THE LONG 
HOURS THEY SPENT DRAWING WATER FROM KIOSKS AS WATER 
WILL BE IN THEIR HOMES AND CLOSE TO THEIR HOMES. 
I AM AWARE THAT WE ARE ALSO CELEBRATING OTHER 
ACHIEVEMENTS ON THIS PROJECT, THE INFRASTRUCTURE 
WORKS ON THE BOMBAY AND MAZYOPA DRAINAGES AND THE 
INNOVATIVE INTERVENTIONS IN SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT. 
7 
THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM WILL ASSIST IN REDUCING 
FLOODING, ESPECIALLY, IN THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT OF 
LUSAKA. 
THE COMPLETION OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, 
WITH THE ASSOCIATED BENEFITS, ARE BECOMING A REALITY 
FOR MANY CITIZENS. 
FOR EXAMPLE, IN LUSAKA, RESIDENTS OF MTENDERE, 
KAMANGA, CHIPATA, NG’OMBE COMPOUNDS AND SOS EAST 
VILLAGE AND THE MEANWOOD AREAS OF NDEKE-VORNA 
VALLEY AND KWAMWENA, ARE BENEFITING FROM WORKS 
BEING FUNDED UNDER THE MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE 
COMPACT. 
IN ADDITION, THE REHABILITATION AND UPGRADING OF 
THE MAIN WATER TREATMENT PLANT IN KAFUE AND THE 
EXPANSION OF THE BACKBONE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK WILL 
RESULT IN INCREASED RELIABILITY OF WATER SUPPLY IN MANY 
PARTS OF LUSAKA. 
8 
I AM ALSO AWARE OF INTERVENTIONS UNDER THE 
INNOVATIONS GRANTS PROGRAM, TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO 
LUSAKA WATER AND SEWERAGE COMPANY AND LUSAKA CITY 
COUNCIL AND THE CREATION OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT 
UTILITY ALL BEING UNDERTAKEN USING THE FUNDING UNDER 
THE MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE COMPACT. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE SUCCESS STORIES FROM 
THESE INTERVENTIONS. 
HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO ENSURE SUSTAINABILITY OF THESE 
INVESTMENTS WE AS CITIZENS NEED TO DO OUR PART. I 
THEREFORE ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO DEVELOP THE CULTURE 
OF KEEPING OUR SURROUNDINGS AND OUR CITY CLEAN. 
I AM COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT THE CITY OF LUSAKA 
AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ARE CLEAN IN ORDER TO 
AVOID DISEASE AND CLOGGING OF DRAINAGES THEREBY 
CAUSING PERENNIAL FLOODING. 
9 
APART FROM THE DIRECT BENEFITS OF WATER SUPPLY, 
SANITATION AND DRAINAGE INFRASTRUCTURE, THIS PROJECT 
HAS CREATED PERMANENT AND TEMPORAL EMPLOYMENT FOR 
OVER 4,000 PEOPLE. 
MORE IMPORTANTLY, OUR CITIZENS HAVE ACQUIRED 
VALUABLE SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO 
TRANSFER TO OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECTS IN THE 
COUNTRY. 
I AM HAPPY TO NOTE THAT ZAMBIA HAS CONTINUED TO 
PERFORM WELL RELATIVE TO OTHER COUNTRIES ON THE 
MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE CORPORATION SCORECARD 
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA IN THE AREAS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, 
ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND INVESTING IN HEALTH AND 
EDUCATION. 
IT WAS ON THIS PREMISE THAT THE ZAMBIAN PEOPLE 
RECEIVED THE GRANT OF US $355 MILLION IN 2012. MY 
GOVERNMENT WILL, THEREFORE, CONTINUE TO WORK 
TOWARDS BUILDING ON THIS GOOD PERFORMANCE FOR THE 
WELLBEING OF THE ZAMBIAN PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. 
10 
AS I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS, I WOULD LIKE TO ASSURE 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE LEFT WITH US TO MEET NOT ONLY OUR NEEDS 
TODAY, BUT THE NEEDS OF THE FUTURE GENERATIONS. 
THIS ENTAILS RESPONSIBILITY BY EVERYONE AND I 
CHALLENGE US TO BEGIN EXERCISING THIS RESPONSIBILITY 
IMMEDIATELY. 
WE REMAIN OPTIMISTIC AS GOVERNMENT THAT ZAMBIA 
WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR A SECOND COMPACT BASED ON 
OUR GREAT PARTNERSHIP AND THE SUCCESS OF THIS FIRST 
COMPACT. 
THEREFORE, LET ME END BY REAFFIRMING THE ZAMBIAN 
GOVERNMENT’S COMMITMENT TO ENHANCED RELATIONS 
AND COOPERATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA FOR THE MUTUAL BENEFIT OUR RESPECTIVE 
PEOPLES. 
I THANK YOU
