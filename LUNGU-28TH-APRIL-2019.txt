I AM TRULY DELIGHTED TO HOST THIS SPECIAL OCCASION IN HONOUR OF YOUR EXCELLENCIES. ZAMBIA IS HUMBLED TO BE GRACED WITH YOUR PRESENCE, THE RENOWNED DIGNITARIES FROM ACROSS THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. 
THIS DISTINGUISHED VISIT BY YOU THE LEADERS OF THE AFRICAN FORUM TO ZAMBIA IS INDEED TIMELY AND BEFITTING. THIS IS BECAUSE IT COINCIDES WITH THE 95TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS OF OUR DR. KENNETH KAUNDA, THE MAN WHO IS OUR FOUNDING FATHER AND THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA. HE IS ALSO ONE OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF THE AFRICA FORUM. 
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT DR. KAUNDA REMAINS AN ICONIC LEADER WHOSE LIFE SHOULD BE CELEBRATED BY ALL AFRICANS. 
THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE DR. KAUNDA PLAYED IN THE LIBERATION OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN REGION, AND THE AFRICAN CONTINENT AT LARGE, HAS TO DATE, REMAINED A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION AND COURAGE FOR OLDER AND YOUNGER GENERATIONS. YOU ARE INDEED OUR INSPIRATION. 
IT IS A WELL-KNOWN FACT THAT DR. KAUNDA, AS A FREEDOM FIGHTER, BELIEVED THAT ZAMBIA’S INDEPENDENCE WAS MEANINGLESS IF THE REST OF THE CONTINENT WAS NOT LIBERATED.

YOUR EXCELLENCIES AND DISTINGUISHED GUESTS: 
THIS FIGHTING SPIRIT FOR A FREE AND LIBERATED AFRICA SHOULD SERVE AS A CRUCIAL REMINDER TO US, THE LEADERS OF TODAY, TO DOUBLE OUR EFFORTS TOWARDS ACHIEVING OUR CONTINENTAL DEVELOPMENTAL ASPIRATIONS OF AGENDA 2063, WHICH CAPTURES OUR POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EMANCIPATION. 
THIS IS WHY I WISH TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSCORE THE REMARKABLE EFFORTS MADE BY THE AFRICA FORUM TO ADVANCE AFRICA'S SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENDA. 
I WISH TO HIGHLIGHT, IN PARTICULAR, THE VARIOUS PROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIES BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THE AREAS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, CONFLICT PREVENTION, REGIONAL INTEGRATION, AND THE ALLEVIATION OF HIV AND AIDS, JUST TO MENTION BUT A FEW. 
THROUGH THE MODEST, YET CRUCIAL INITIATIVES IN THESE AREAS, I AM CONFIDENT THAT OUR CONTINENT WILL COME TO THE REALISATION OF OUR EXTRAORDINARY POTENTIAL, AS A COMMON PEOPLE, AND FORGE AHEAD BEYOND OUR HARDSHIPS AND SHORTCOMINGS. 
INDEED, AS AFRICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WE MUST HARNESS THE VAST WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF OUR LEADERS BEFORE US, TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT AND DYNAMICS OF THE WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY. WE CAN NOT DO WITHOUT YOUR WISDOM.

YOUR EXCELLENCIES AND DISTINGUISHED GUESTS: 
IT IS A REALITY THAT INTER-STATE CONFLICTS AMONGST OUR PEOPLES HAS REMAINED A SERIOUS HINDRANCE TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT, AS THE EFFECTS OF COLONIAL RULE AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES ARE STILL EVIDENT TODAY. 
ALLOW ME, YOUR EXCELLENCIES, IN THIS REGARD TO COMMEND THE GOOD WORKS OF THE AFRICA FORUM IN THE AREA OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. 
SINCE ITS ESTABLISHMENT IN MAPUTO, IN 2006, THE FORUM HAS IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL PEACE SUPPORT MISSIONS AND MEDIATION EFFORTS ACROSS AFRICA SUCH AS IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC), KENYA, LIBERIA, AND THE MADAGASCAR AMONG OTHERS. 
I, THEREFORE, YOUR EXCELLENCIES WISH TO REAFFIRM THE ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT’S COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE AFRICA FORUM. 
THIS IS IN OUR QUEST TO FOSTER A MORE PEACEFUL, PROSPEROUS, STABLE AND CONFLICT FREE AFRICA, DURING AND AFTER ZAMBIA’S CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) ORGAN ON POLITICS, DEFENCE AND SECURITY COOPERATION.

AS I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS ALLOW ME TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF UNITY, THE SPIRIT OF UBUNTU, IF WE ARE TO ATTAIN OUR CONTINENTAL OBJECTS IN LINE WITH AGENDA 2063. 
WE CAN ONLY GENUINELY ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE SPIRIT OF UNITY. 
THIS SAME SPIRIT MUST BE AT THE CENTER OF OUR DECISION MAKING PROCESSES AT ALL LEVELS OF COOPERATION, MOST IMPORTANTLY, AT REGIONAL, SUB- REGIONAL AND MULTILATERAL LEVELS.
