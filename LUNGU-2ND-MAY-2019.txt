• DISTINGUISHED GUESTS; 
• LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO BE HERE IN SOUTHERN PROVINCE, TO OFFICIATE AT THE SIACHITEMA AGRICULTURAL BLOCK FIELD DAY. 
I AM HERE FOR VERY SPECIAL REASONS; FIRSTLY TO LOOK AT THE STATUS OF AGRICULTURE IN THE PROVINCE AND SECONDLY TO SEEK WAYS OF HOW WE CAN INCREASE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN THIS REGION. 
THIS IS, PARTICULARLY, IN LIGHT OF THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED SOUTHERN PROVINCE AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. 
I AM AWARE OF THE HIGH POTENTIAL THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR HAS IN THE PROVINCE AND HOW THE PROVINCE USED TO BE THE FOOD BASKET OF THE COUNTRY BEFORE THE EMERGENCE OF THE CHANGING CLIMATIC CONDITIONS.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
CLIMATIC CONDITIONS, IN TERMS OF RAINFALL, HAVE DRASTICALLY CHANGED IN THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND HAVE SINCE SHIFTED TO THE NORTHERN HALF, THEREBY MAKING AGRICULTURE HERE IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE VULNERABLE. 
EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD, HOWEVER, NOT PREVENT US FROM DEVELOPING AGRICULTURE IN THE PROVINCE AS IT IS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF LIVELIHOOD FOR OUR PEOPLE. THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD, INSTEAD, STRENGTHEN US TO FIND INNOVATIVE WAYS OF FARMING. 
THE VENUE FOR THIS FIELD DAY WAS SPECIFICALLY CHOSEN BECAUSE THE HOST FARMER, MR. RAYMOND MUFWAMBI, HAS BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE HIGH YIELDS OF MAIZE DESPITE THE DRY SPELL, WHILE OTHER FARMERS IN THE SAME AREA DID NOT MANAGE TO PRODUCE ANYTHING UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS. CLEARLY, THERE IS SOMETHING WE ALL NEED TO LEARN FROM THIS FARMER. 
I AM INFORMED THAT, OUR HOST, USED THE RIGHT SEED VARIETY RECOMMENDED FOR THE AREA. HE ALSO PLANTED ON TIME AND APPLIED GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. THIS RESULTED IN HIS CROP SURVIVING AND WE ARE ALL WITNESSING THIS TODAY. THIS IS COMMENDABLE!

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
I, THEREFORE, WISH TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ENCOURAGE OTHER FARMERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO EMULATE WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE TODAY. IT IS POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE A GOOD CROP, GIVEN THE RIGHT VARIETY OF SEED AND GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES, DESPITE POOR CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. 
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN SOUTHERN PROVINCE HAS REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS OWING TO THE CHANGE IN CLIMATE. FOR INSTANCE, IN TERMS OF MAIZE PRODUCTION, A TOTAL OF 582,984 METRIC TONNES WAS PRODUCED IN 2010 COMPARED TO 361,155 METRIC TONNES IN 2018, REPRESENTING A REDUCTION OF THIRTY-EIGHT PERCENT. 
THIS SCENARIO IS INDEED WORRYING AND AS GOVERNMENT, WE NEED TO RE-STRATEGISE AND COME UP WITH URGENT SOLUTIONS. 
I AM CERTAIN THAT THE PRODUCTION FIGURES FOR THIS YEAR, WHICH THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE WILL SOON BE ANNOUNCING, WILL BE FAR LESS THAN THE 2018 FIGURES DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. 
MOVING FORWARD, WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND DEVISE INNOVATIVE WAYS, AND ADOPT NEW AND IMPROVED CLIMATE SMART FARMING METHODS.

THESE INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, PRACTICING CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE, GROWING APPROPRIATE DROUGHT RESILIENT CROP VARIETIES AND PLANTING AT THE RIGHT TIME. 
I WANT TO SEE THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE TAKING PRACTICAL STEPS TOWARDS ENSURING THAT FARMERS ADOPT CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE. THIS IS THE WAY TO GO UNDER SUCH CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. 
LET ME ALSO EMPHASISE THAT FOOD SECURITY IS NOT JUST MAIZE. WE CAN ALSO BE FOOD SECURE BY GROWING OTHER CROPS SUCH AS CASSAVA, MILLET, BEANS, AND SORGHUM, AMONG OTHERS.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FELLOW FARMERS, 
MOVING AWAY FROM MAIZE, LET ME NOW TALK ABOUT THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY, BEARING IN MIND THAT SOUTHERN PROVINCE, PARTICULARLY KALOMO DISTRICT, USED TO BE ONE OF THE MAJOR TOBACCO PRODUCING AREAS. 
TOBACCO PRODUCTION IN THE COUNTRY HAS ALSO SEEN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION NOT JUST BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT FOR OTHER REASONS AS WELL. 
IN 2012, SOUTHERN PROVINCE, IN PARTICULAR, PRODUCED A TOTAL OF 10,276 METRIC TONNES OF VIRGINIA TOBACCO COMPARED TO 5,424 METRIC TONNES IN 2018, REPRESENTING A REDUCTION OF ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT. 
THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED SET-BACKS NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS, BUT ALSO DUE TO EITHER POOR REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS OR LACK OF CONSENSUS AMONG STAKEHOLDERS. 
YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT WE HAVE CONTROL OVER MAN-MADE PROBLEMS UNLIKE NATURAL EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. 
I, THEREFORE, URGE THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE TO CONTINUE ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS STARTING WITH GENUINE GROWERS, PROCESSORS AND MERCHANTS SO THAT YOU ALL COME UP WITH A WIN- WIN SITUATION AND MOVE THE SUB-SECTOR FURTHER.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN; FELLOW FARMERS: 
THE COUNTRY STANDS TO BENEFIT IF WE CAN INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF TOBACCO AND EARN THE MUCH-NEEDED FOREIGN EXCHANGE. 
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN AT RISK OF RECEIVING MIXED SIGNALS FROM DIFFERENT SUB-SECTOR STAKEHOLDERS IN AGRICULTURE. 
GOING FORWARD, WE WILL BE MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS’ CONSENSUS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY PLAYER IN THE SECTOR IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE OTHER. 
WITH REGARDS TO THE LIVESTOCK SUB-SECTOR, I AM PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF LIVESTOCK DISEASES WHICH HAVE BEEN RAVAGING OUR LIVESTOCK POPULATION IN THE PROVINCE, ESPECIALLY CATTLE. 
LET US, AS A MATTER OF URGENCY, WORK FLAT-OUT AND PUT IN PLACE MEASURES TO PREVENT DISEASE OCCURRENCES. 
OF LATE, WE HAVE HEARD SO MANY REPORTS OF DISEASE OUTBREAKS, PARTICULARLY FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE, WHICH THE MINISTRY OF FISHERIES AND LIVESTOCK MUST FIGHT TO BRING IT TO AN END.

DESPITE EXPERIENCING UNFAVOURABLE RAINFALL PATTERNS DURING THE PREVIOUS AGRICULTURAL SEASON, GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT NO SINGLE LIFE IS LOST DUE TO HUNGER. 
UNDER THE OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT, THE DISASTER MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION UNIT HAS BEEN MONITORING THE SITUATION CLOSELY TO ENSURE THAT FOOD IS DISTRIBUTED TO THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. 
MY GOVERNMENT WILL NOT LET OUR CITIZENS DOWN, AS WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY OF LOOKING AFTER EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY. 
IN FACT, APART FROM OFFICIATING AT THIS FIELD DAY, MY COMING HERE IS ALSO TO OFFICIALLY LAUNCH THE RELIEF FOOD DISTRIBUTION EXERCISE IN SOUTHERN PROVINCE. 
I, THEREFORE, URGE ALL THE HOUSEHOLD BENEFICIARIES OF THIS RELIEF FOOD AND ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN THE DISTRIBUTION TO BE PATRIOTIC AND AVOID RE-SELLING THE FOOD. THIS FOOD IS FOR YOUR CONSUMPTION, IT IS FOR YOUR WELL-BEING, AND FOR YOUR GOOD HEALTH.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
AS I DIRECTED PREVIOUSLY, I WILL SOON BE MAKING FOLLOW-UPS REGARDING THE NEED TO SUPPLY SEED AND FERTILISER IN GOOD TIME, UNDER THE FAMER INPUT SUPPORT PROGRAMME. 
I WILL ALSO MAKE SIMILAR FOLLOW–UPS REGARDING MAIZE AND MEALIE-MEAL MARKETING AMONG ALL THE PLAYERS SUCH AS THE GRAIN TRADERS, MILLERS AND THE FOOD RESERVE AGENCY. 
AS PRESIDENT OF THIS GREAT NATION, I WILL NOT REST UNTIL I SEE TO IT THAT THINGS ARE PUT RIGHT AND ARE WORKING FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL ZAMBIANS. 
IT WILL NOT DO FOR US TO BE RHETORICAL ABOUT THE COUNTRY’S POTENTIAL IN AGRICULTURE OR ANY OTHER SECTOR FOR THAT MATTER, WITHOUT TAKING PRACTICAL STEPS TO REALISE THAT POTENTIAL. 
WE HAVE SPOKEN A LOT ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE, OUR POTENTIAL TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT, BUT IT IS NOW TIME TO UNLOCK THIS POTENTIAL. 
THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW FOR US TO TRANSFORM THE SECTOR INTO BEING THE MAIN DRIVER FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS WE HAVE RIGHTLY STATED IN THE 7TH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN. 
THIS IS WHY I TREASURE EVENTS LIKE THIS ONE, WHERE INFORMATION IS SHARED AND, THEREFORE, THE MORE REASON I HAVE TAKEN KEEN INTEREST TO BE WITH YOU HERE AND OFFICIATE AT THIS IMPORTANT OCCASSION.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
WE CAN DO A LOT FOR OUR COUNTRY AS LONG AS WE MAKE AGRICULTURE OUR MAINSTAY. LET US CONTINUE TO MAKE AGRICULTURE OUR BUSINESS. LET US LEARN THE NEW METHODS OF AGRICULTURE FOR US TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE BOTH FOR OUR OWN CONSUMPTION, AND FOR SALE FOR OUR INCOMES. THERE IS A LOT WE CAN DO AS LONG AS WE WORK TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY. 
IN CONCLUSION, I WISH TO SINCERELY THANK OUR HOST FARMER, ALL THE SPONSORS AND ORGANISERS AND ALL OF YOU PRESENT FOR MAKING THIS FIELD DAY POSSIBLE. 
I ALSO WISH TO THANK YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS FOR FINDING TIME TO BE WITH US ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT OCCASION. YOUR PRESENCE IS VERY INSPIRING. 
IT IS NOW MY SINGULAR HONOUR AND PRIVILEGE TO OFFICIALLY DECLARE THIS FIELD DAY OPEN. 
MAY GOD BLESS OUR COUNTRY, MAY GOD BLESS US ALL, I THANK YOU ALL.
