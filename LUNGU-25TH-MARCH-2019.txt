        I WELCOME YOU ALL TO ZAMBIA’S TOURIST CAPITAL, LIVINGSTONE, WHERE THE 26TH EAST AND SOUTHERN AFRICA ASSOCIATION OF ACCOUNTANTS-GENERAL’S 2019 ANNUAL CONFERENCE IS BEING HELD UNDER THE THEME: “ENHANCING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND EMERGING ECONOMIES.”


          THE THEME OF THE CONFERENCE IS NOT ONLY APPROPRIATE, BUT ALSO CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REFORMS BEING UNDERTAKEN IN THE REGION.




















DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES;
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:


           MY GOVERNMENT ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE EAST AND SOUTHERN AFRICA ASSOCIATION OF ACCOUNTANTS-GENERAL. THIS IS BECAUSE OF ITS ROLE IN ENHANCING ACCOUNTABILITY AND PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC RESOURCES IN THE REGION.  


          IT IS GRATIFYING THAT ZAMBIA HAS YET AGAIN BEEN PRIVILEGED TO HOST THIS IMPORTANT ANNUAL CONFERENCE AFTER THE MAIDEN ONE IN 2010, WHICH WAS HOSTED HERE AT THE SAME VENUE.


         THE AFRICAN CONTINENT IN GENERAL AND THE EAST AND SOUTHERN AFRICA IN PARTICULAR, IS WELL ENDOWED WITH NATURAL RESOURCES SUCH AS VAST ARABLE LAND, FORESTS, MINERALS, RIVERS AND LAKES, ANIMALS, GOOD CLIMATE, A RICH CULTURAL HERITAGE AND A VIBRANT AND HARD WORKING POPULATION. 


        DESPITE ALL THESE ENDOWMENTS, AFRICA’S RESOURCES REMAINS UNEXPLOITED DISADVANTAGING HER PEOPLE.  HOWEVER, I AM GLAD TO STATE THAT AFRICA IS UNDERGOING MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION IN ALL AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT.














LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:


         THE ROLE OF ACCOUNTANTS IS CARDINAL IN TRANSFORMING AFRICA INTO A PROSPEROUS AND PEACEFUL CONTINENT. FOR US TO ACHIEVE THIS VISION, WE NEED TO BUILD AND PUT IN PLACE THE RIGHT SYSTEMS, DEVELOP THE RIGHT MINDSET AND PERFORM OUR FUNCTIONS WITH INTEGRITY, PROFESSIONALISM AND HARD WORK. 


        I WISH TO NOTE THAT FAILURE FOR MOST OF OUR ACCOUNTANTS TO DILIGENTLY SERVE THE PEOPLE IS NOT DUE TO LACK OF KNOWLEDGE, SKILL OR COMPETENCE, BUT IT IS BECAUSE OF TILTED FOCUS ON PERSONAL INTEREST AT THE EXPENSE OF PUBLIC INTEREST. 


         IT IS INDEED DISHEARTENING THAT SOME ACCOUNTANTS HAVE BECOME ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE BY BEING INVOLVED IN FINANCIAL TRANSGRESSIONS IN ORDER TO QUICKLY AMASS WEALTH AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR CITIZENS.


          THERE IS NOW GREATER DEMAND THAN EVER BEFORE, BY CITIZENS, IN OUR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES FOR TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC RESOURCES. 
          OUR CITIZENS WANT TO SEE VALUE FOR THE TAXES THEY REMIT TO GOVERNMENT BEING USED FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHICH POSITIVELY IMPACT ON THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE.  OUR CITIZENS DEMAND GOOD SCHOOLS; GOOD HEALTH FACILITIES; GOOD ROADS; SAFE WATER AND SANITATION; AND ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY AMONG OTHER BASIC HUMAN NEEDS.
 




          AS PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR PUBLIC FINANCES, HOW DO YOU THEREFORE BECOME A FORCE FOR GOOD? IT IS NO DOUBT THAT YOU NEED TO BECOME ACCOUNTABLE AND TRANSPARENT. YOU NEED TO STOP MISUSE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES, YOU NEED TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC RESOURCES ARE TARGETED TOWARDS DELIVERY OF PUBLIC GOODS AND SERVICES TO BENEFIT THE PEOPLE IN YOUR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES.


        IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU ACCOUNTANTS TO PRODUCE FINANCIAL REPORTS WHICH OUR CITIZENS CANNOT READ OR UNDERSTAND. LET US THEREFORE, ENDEAVOUR TO PRODUCE SIMPLIFIED FINANCIAL REPORTS TO ENABLE CITIZENS APPRECIATE THE LINK BETWEEN THE REVENUES GENERATED AND THE GOODS AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY YOUR RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS. 


         I ALSO WISH TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLORE YOU TO CREATE AWARENESS AMONG CITIZENS TO STIR THEIR INTEREST IN FINANCIAL REPORTS TO ENABLE THEM KNOW HOW THEIR RESOURCES ARE BEING UTILISED. 


          YOU NEED TO REALISE THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOUR GOVERNMENTS USE AND ACCOUNT FOR PUBLIC RESOURCES HAS AN IMPACT ON DEVELOPMENT, INVESTMENT, JOB CREATION AND POVERTY REDUCTION.




















DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:


           THE ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE ENHANCEMENT OF PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT TO SUPPORT OUR DEVELOPMENT AGENDA WHICH IS BASED ON THE VISION 2030 AND THE 7TH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN. 


          IN THIS REGARD, WE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING A COMPREHENSIVE PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REFORM PROGRAMME AIMED AT STRENGTHENING THE PLANNING AND BUDGETING PROCESS, FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING, PUBLIC PROCUREMENT, REVENUE ADMINISTRATION, EXTERNAL AUDIT AND WITH EMPHASIS ON PARLIAMENTARY OVERSIGHT. 


         AS GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE NOTHING TO CONCEAL. YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT OUR COUNTRY’S PARLIAMENTARY PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE IS VERY ACTIVE HENCE THE EXECUTIVE ARM OF GOVERNMENT IS MADE TO ANSWER TO ANY QUERRIES RAISED WITH REGARD TO UTILISATION OF PUBLIC FUNDS.


          IT IS THEREFORE PLEASING THAT THESE REFORMS HAVE BEGAN TO YIELD POSITIVE RESULTS IN ZAMBIA SUCH AS REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER AND VALUE OF AUDIT QUERIES, PROGRESSIVE INCREASE IN REVENUE COLLECTIONS AND TIMELY PRODUCTION OF AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 














          FURTHER, GOVERNMENT HAS PUT IN PLACE A NEW PUBLIC FINANCE LAW WHICH HAS ADDRESSED WEAKNESSES IDENTIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS LAW. THE OLD LAW HAS SINCE BEEN REPEALED. 


        THE NEW LAW STIPULATES PUNITIVE SANCTIONS FOR FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT, PROVISIONS DEALING WITH THE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF ASSETS AMONG OTHERS.


        GOING FORWARD, MY GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE ENHANCING AND STRENGTHENING PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO BUILD PUBLIC TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR SYSTEMS OF GOVERNANCE.


        AFTER ALL, THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY DEMANDS FOR. FOR THIS REASON, MY GOVERNMENT IS KEEN TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY AS ONE OF THE TENETS OF DEMOCRACY.
































LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:


            THE 26TH EAST AND SOUTHERN AFRICA ASSOCIATION OF ACCOUNTANTS-GENERAL’S ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROVIDES MEMBER STATES A PLATFORM AND OPPORTUNITY FOR GREATER COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION, SHARING OF UNIQUE COUNTRY EXPERIENCES, AS WELL AS BENCHMARKING EACH OTHER IN THE AREA OF PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. 


          THE CONFERENCE ALSO ACCORDS THE DELEGATES IN THE REGION, A FORUM TO GET UPDATES ON EMERGING CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS IN THE ACCOUNTANCY PROFESSION.


            I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS CONFERENCE WILL GO A LONG WAY IN PROMOTING GOOD FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE AND CLOSER COOPERATION AMONG MEMBER STATES. 


           ULTIMATELY, OUR DESIRE IS TO SEE THAT PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC RESOURCES IS ENTRENCHED AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE LIVING CONDITIONS OF OUR CITIZENS IN OUR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES.


















  
         I, THEREFORE, URGE YOU ALL TO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE DELIBERATIONS AND PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE CONFERENCE. YOU HAVE A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO AFRICA’S SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION WHICH OFFERS ITS PEOPLE A BETTER FUTURE OF OPPORTUNITIES AND PROSPERITY.  IN THIS REGARD, WHAT YOU DO TODAY, WILL EITHER HAVE A NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE IMPACT ON FUTURE GENERATIONS. 


           TURNING TO THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE, THE VICINITY OF ONE OF THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD, THE MIGHTY VICTORIA FALLS. 


          I URGE YOU TO TAKE TIME TO UNWIND AND VISIT THIS AWESOME NATIONAL TOURIST SPOT WHICH IS RIGHT BEHIND THIS HOTEL AND IS LOCATED IN THE MOSI-O-TUNYA NATIONAL GAME PARK. THE GAME PARK IS ENDOWED WITH DIFFERENT SPECIES OF ANIMALS AMONG THEM ELEPHANTS, LIONS, GIRAFFES, AND BUFFALOES, A SPECTACLE NOT TO MISS. THERE ARE OTHER INTERESTING TOURIST SITES LOCATED WITHIN THE GREATER LIVINGSTONE CITY FOR YOU TO SAMPLE.


       IT IS NOW MY SINGULAR HONOUR AND PRIVILEGE TO DECLARE THE 26TH EAST AND SOUTHERN AFRICA ASSOCIATION OF ACCOUNTANTS-GENERAL’S 2019 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OFFICIALLY OPENED.


MAY GOD BLESS OUR CONTINENT, AFRICA,
I THANK YOU ALL.
