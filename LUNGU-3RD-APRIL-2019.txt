IT IS WITH GREAT PLEASURE THAT I AM HERE TODAY TO COMMISSION PHASE I OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MUKUBA UNIVERSITY HERE IN THE COPPERBELT PROVINCE. 
IT IS GRATIFYING THAT TODAY, THIS INSTITUTION IS BEING COMMISSIONED TO OFFICIALLY OPERATE AS A UNIVERSITY. 
THIS IS INDEED A MOMENTOUS OCCASION AS IT DEMONSTRATES MY GOVERNMENT’S DESIRE TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION AT HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL, BUT ALSO TO ASSURE QUALITY LIVELIHOODS TO THE PEOPLE OF ZAMBIA. THIS IS THROUGH EMPLOYMENT CREATION AND HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT.

DISTINGUISHED GUESTS; LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
THE PATRIOTIC FRONT GOVERNMENT REMAINS COMMITTED TO TRANSFORMING THE LIVES OF OUR PEOPLE. THEREFORE, THERE IS NO BETTER WAY THAN BRINGING QUALITY EDUCATION CLOSER TO THE PEOPLE. 
IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT EDUCATION OPENS OPPORTUNITIES IN LIFE, AND IS A KEY INGREDIENT TO NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, PROSPERITY AND THE WELLBEING OF ANY NATION. 
THEREFORE, IF WE HAVE TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TO SUSTAIN OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH, IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR US TO HAVE APPROPRIATELY SKILLED AND EDUCATED PEOPLE. 
IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS CONTINUED TO IMPLEMENT PLANS NOT ONLY AIMED AT INCREASING ACCESS TO EDUCATION BUT EQUALLY ENSURING QUALITY AND RELEVANT EDUCATION, WHICH RESPONDS TO THE ISSUES AFFECTING ZAMBIA TODAY, AT ALL LEVELS OF EDUCATION. 
ONE WAY THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED IS TO ENSURE THAT WE PUT UP ADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING.

DISTINGUISHED GUESTS; LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
I AM THEREFORE, DELIGHTED TO BE COMMISSIONING THE COMPLETED PHASE I OF EXPANSION WORKS AT THIS UNIVERSITY, TODAY. THESE FACILITIES WILL FORM THE BEDROCK TO ENHANCING ACCESS TO QUALITY TRAINING. 
THE PROCESS OF ENHANCING INFRASTRUCTURE IN VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING HAS BEEN SLOW DUE TO THE RESTRAINED RESOURCE ENVELOPE. HOWEVER, I AM HAPPY THAT WE MADE PROGRESS TOWARDS THIS PROJECT AND WE WILL MOVE ON. 
YOU MAY RECALL THAT UNDER HIGHER EDUCATION, WE PROMISED TO CONSTRUCT AT LEAST ONE UNIVERSITY IN EACH OF THE TEN PROVINCES. 
SO FAR, WE HAVE SIX UNIVERSITIES WHICH ARE IN MUCHINGA, LUSAKA AND CENTRAL PROVINCES. THIS INCLUDES KWAME NKRUMAH UNIVERSITY IN KABWE DISTRICT OF CENTRAL PROVINCE, WHICH I COMMISSIONED ON SATURDAY, 30 OF MARCH THIS YEAR. 
I AM ALSO GLAD TO ANNOUNCE THAT CONSTRUCTION WORKS HAVE COMMENCED FOR UNIVERSITIES IN LUAPULA, NORTHERN AND WESTERN PROVINCES, AND WE HAVE FURTHER PLANS TO CONSTRUCT UNIVERSITIES IN EASTERN AND NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
NEXT, I WILL BE COMMISSIONING MWENSE TRADES TRAINING INSTITUTE IN LUAPULA PROVINCE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
AS GOVERNMENT WE HAVE A DUTY TO ENSURING ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION AND OTHER SOCIAL SECTORS BY ALL ZAMBIAN CITIZENS. WE REMAIN COMMITTED AND IMPARTIAL TO OUR PROMISE TO DELIVER QUALITY SERVICES TO ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. 
THEREFORE, I WILL NOT CONDONE DISCRIMINATION OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AGAINST CERTAIN REGIONS. ALL THE PEOPLE OF ZAMBIA REGARDLESS, OF WHERE THEY ARE, HAVE THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO SOCIAL SERVICES. 
A CHILD IN SHANGOMBO, ANOTHER IN LUNGA AND ONE IN LUSAKA SHOULD ALL HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO TERTIARY EDUCATION WITHOUT BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. 
I THEREFORE, WISH TO SOUND A CLARION CALL TO ALL THOSE REPONSIBLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF VARIOUS DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECTS TO AVOID THE TEMPTATION OF DISCRIMINATING AGAINST CERTAIN REGIONS. WE THE PF GOVERNMENT HAVE A MANDATE TO TAKE DEVELOPMENT TO ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
AT THIS POINT, I WISH TO EXPRESS MY DELIGHT ON THE GREAT STRIDES WE HAVE MADE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURAL PROJECTS IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS HEALTH, ROAD AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AMONG OTHERS. 
WE SHALL CONTINUE WITH THIS AMBITIOUS INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMME THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT TRAJECTORY WE WILL RESOLUTELY PURSUE UNTIL EVERY CITIZEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAS ACCESS TO DECENT SOCIAL AMENITIES.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
THE PHASE 1 OF THIS PROJECT, I AM COMMISSIONING TODAY, COMMENCED ON 27TH APRIL, 2009 AND CONSISTS OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO HOSTEL BLOCKS, TWO DOUBLE STOREY LECTURE ROOM BLOCKS, ONE LECTURE THEATRE AND A DOUBLE STOREY LIBRARY BLOCK AT AN AGGREGATED COST OF SEVENTY-FOUR MILLION KWACHA. 
IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THIS EXPANSION HAS INCREASED STUDENT BED SPACE FROM THE CURRENT 336 TO 816. IT IS AN INCREASE OF OVER 40 PERCENT IN THE INSTITUTION’S CAPACITY. 
THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS RESULTED IN STUDENTS BEING BROUGHT CLOSER TO THEIR LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND A GREAT RELIEF TO STUDENTS WHO PREVIOUSLY HAD TO SECURE ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATION IN GARNETON AREA, AND THOSE WHO WERE COMMUTING FROM HOME AT GREAT COST. 
PHASE II OF THE PROJECT WHICH IS YET TO BE COMPLETED, COMMENCED ON 26TH APRIL, 2013 AND CONSISTS OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO HOSTEL BLOCKS; TWO LECTURE ROOM BLOCKS, TEN LECTURERS’ HOUSES AND ONE LECTURE THEATRE AT A TOTAL COST OF FORTY- EIGHT MILLION KWACHA.

THIS PHASE CURRENTLY STANDS AT 50 PERCENT COMPLETION AND I WISH TO REITERATE GOVERNMENT’S UNWAVERING DETERMINATION TO COMPLETE THIS PHASE IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME. 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS AND OTHER SIMILAR PROJECTS HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY THE COLLABORATION OF VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS. 
IN THIS REGARD, LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COMMEND AND THANK ALL THOSE WHO HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY IN ENSURING THAT WE ACHIEVE OUR INTENDED PLANS. 
I WISH TO URGE THE MINISTRY OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO CONTINUE SOLICITING FOR SUPPORT FROM THE TREASURY AND OTHER SOURCES TO ENSURE THE REALISATION OF OUR VISION OF TRANSFORMING MUKUBA UNIVERSITY AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS INTO UNIVERSITIES WITH REQUISITE INFRASTRUCTURE. 
THIS COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IS A TESTAMENT OF POSITIVE OUTCOMES OF AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT AS FRAMED IN OUR SEVENTH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN. 
I FURTHER URGE ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO CONTINUE CONTRIBUTING POSITIVELY TO THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE ENTIRE PROJECT AND TO EXTEND THIS SERVICE BEYOND THE UNIVERSITY.

I ALSO WISH TO THANK THE CONTRACTOR HUA JIANG INVESTMENTS ZAMBIA LIMITED FOR THE EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY OF WORK UNDERTAKEN ON THIS PROJECT. ALL PROJECTS THAT WE UNDERTAKE AS GOVERNMENT MUST DEMONSTRATE VALUE FOR MONEY. WITH THIS PROJECT, I AM CERTAIN THE NATION WILL GAIN VALUE FOR THEIR MONEY PAID IN FORM OF TAXES. 
DISTINGUISHED GUEST; LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
I WISH TO CONCLUDE BY REITERATING MY GOVERNMENT’S COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING AND ADVANCING HIGHER EDUCATION THROUGH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INFRASTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT. 
I FURTHER WISH TO IMPLORE EVERYONE ON THE COPPERBELT AND THE COUNTRY AT LARGE TO SAFEGUARD THIS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT AT HUGE COSTS. 
LET US CONTINUE TO REMAIN PATRIOTIC AND GUARD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE JEALOUSLY FOR OURSELVES AND THOSE COMING BEHIND US. 
I THANK YOU. 
GOD BLESS YOU ALL, GOD BLESS ZAMBIA.
