REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA 
ADDRESS 
BY 
HIS EXCELLENCY 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA 
MR. EDGAR CHAGWA LUNGU, 
ON THE 
PROGRESS MADE IN THE APPLICATION OF NATIONAL 
VALUES AND PRINCIPLES 
DELIVERED 
TO THE THIRD SESSION OF THE TWELTH NATIONAL 
ASSEMBLY 
ON 
FRIDAY, 15TH MARCH, 2019 
INTRODUCTION 
MR. SPEAKER, 
1. WE, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY RESOLVED TO 
COMMIT OURSELVES TO UPHOLDING A DEFINED SET OF 
NATIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES UNDER ARTICLE 8 OF THE 
CONSTITUTION. WE ALSO DECIDED, UNDER ARTICLE 9, SUB- 
ARTICLE (2), THAT THE PRESIDENT SHALL REPORT TO THIS 
HOUSE, ONCE A YEAR, PROGRESS MADE IN THE APPLICATION 
OF OUR NATIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES. TODAY, I AM 
HERE TO DO JUST THAT. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
2. BEFORE I PROCEED WITH MY ADDRESS, MAY I REQUEST 
THE HOUSE TO STAND AND JOIN ME IN OBSERVING A MINUTE 
OF SILENCE IN HONOUR OF THE LATE HONOURABLE MEMBER 
OF PARLIAMENT FOR SESHEKE CONSTITUENCY, MR. FRANK 
SIMONA KUFWAKWANDI, WHO WENT TO BE WITH THE LORD 
ON 12TH NOVEMBER, 2018. [PAUSE] 
3. THE HOUSE, THE COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE OF SESHEKE 
WILL GREATLY MISS HIS SERVICES. MAY HIS SOUL REST IN 
ETERNAL PEACE. 
1 
MR. SPEAKER, 
4. FOLLOWING THE DEMISE OF THE FORMER HONOURABLE 
MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR MANGANGO CONSTITUENCY, MR. 
NALUWA MWEENE AND THE FORMER HONOURABLE MEMBER OF 
PARLIAMENT FOR SESHEKE CONSTITUENCY, MR. FRANK 
SIMONA KUFWAKWANDI, NEW MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT HAVE 
SINCE BEEN ELECTED TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF THE TWO 
CONSTITUENCIES. 
5. LET ME NOW WELCOME THE NEW MEMBER OF 
PARLIAMENT FOR MANGANGO CONSTITUENCY, HONOURABLE 
GODWIN PUTU AND THE NEW MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR 
SESHEKE CONSTITUENCY, HONOURABLE ROMEO KANG’OMBE. 
6. YOUR ELECTION VICTORIES ARE A CLEAR 
DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUST THAT YOU EARNED AMONG 
THE PEOPLE OF MANGANGO AND SESHEKE. THAT TRUST, 
HOWEVER, COMES WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DELIVER ON 
YOUR CAMPAIGN PROMISES. SO, DO NOT LET OUR PEOPLE 
DOWN. 
7. IN WELCOMING YOU, WE ARE ALL REMINDED OF THE 
EXPECTATIONS OF OUR PEOPLE. OUR PEOPLE ARE YEARNING 
FOR DEVELOPMENT. DEVELOPMENT THAT IS PEOPLE-CENTRED. 
DEVELOPMENT THAT SECURES OUR FUTURE. DEVELOPMENT 
2 
THAT DOES NOT LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND. WE SHOULD, 
THEREFORE, USE THIS PRIVILEGE OF SERVICE TO IMPROVE 
THE LIVES OF OUR PEOPLE. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
8. AS I PROCEED TO GIVE THE PROGRESS ON THE 
APPLICATION OF OUR NATIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES, IT 
IS IMPORTANT TO RE-STATE WHAT OUR NATIONAL VALUES 
AND PRINCIPLES ARE: 
i) MORALITY AND ETHICS; 
ii) PATRIOTISM AND NATIONAL UNITY; 
iii) DEMOCRACY AND CONSTITUTIONALISM; 
iv) HUMAN DIGNITY, EQUITY, SOCIAL JUSTICE, 
EQUALITY 
AND NON-DISCRIMINATION; 
v) GOOD GOVERNANCE AND INTEGRITY; AND 
vi) SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
3 
9. A NATION ANCHORED ON FIRM VALUES AND PRINCIPLES 
ACCOMPLISHES GREAT THINGS. ONE GREAT ECONOMIST, JOHN 
MAYNARD KEYNES, ONCE SAID, AND I QUOTE: 
“PEOPLE ARE MOVED TO ACTION BY WHAT THEY 
BELIEVE.” END OF QUOTE. 
10. INDEED, OUR WORDS, OUR TALK AND THE THOUGHTS 
THAT PREOCCUPY US DO MATTER. THEY POINT TO THE IDEALS 
WE LIVE BY. BEING A NATION OF FAITH, A CHRISTIAN NATION, 
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE TAKE TIME TO REFLECT AND TALK 
ABOUT OUR NATIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES. THIS IS 
BECAUSE OUR CHARACTER AND HONOUR IS JUDGED BY OUR 
SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
11. WE MEET TODAY TO RE-AFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO 
UPHOLDING OUR NATIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES. MORE 
IMPORTANTLY, THE PURPOSE OF THIS OCCASION IS FOR US TO 
GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT WE ARE DOING AS A NATION TO 
APPLY THESE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES. 
12. I WILL NOW HIGHLIGHT THE PROGRESS WE MADE IN 2018 
UNDER EACH VALUE AND PRINCIPLE AS ENSHRINED IN THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
4 
MORALITY AND ETHICS 
MR. SPEAKER, 
13. MORALITY AND ETHICS ARE VALUES THAT DEFINE WHAT 
WE, AS A PEOPLE, COLLECTIVELY BELIEVE TO BE RIGHT OR 
WRONG. IN SOME INSTANCES, THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY 
BE WRITTEN DOWN. 
14. I WISH TO REPORT THAT WE ARE MAKING STRIDES IN 
PROMOTING MORALITY AND ETHICS IN OUR NATION. IN THE 
AREA OF GENDER BASED VIOLENCE, WHICH REMAINS ONE OF 
THE CRITICAL MORAL ISSUES OF OUR TIME, WE HAVE 
INTENSIFIED AWARENESS PROGRAMMES AT EVERY LEVEL OF 
OUR SOCIETY INCLUDING OUR COMMUNITIES, SCHOOLS, 
WORK PLACES AND PLACES OF WORSHIP. 
15. THIS AWARENESS RESULTED IN INCREASED REPORTING 
OF GENDER BASED VIOLENCE CASES FROM 21,504 IN 2017 TO 
22,073 IN 2018. WE ARE ADDRESSING THE CONSEQUENCES 
OF GENDER BASED VIOLENCE BY PROVIDING MORAL, 
EMOTIONAL, MEDICAL AND LEGAL SUPPORT TO VICTIMS. TO 
THIS EFFECT, COUNSELING AND LEGAL SUPPORT WAS 
5 
PROVIDED TO 8,682 VICTIMS COMPRISING 5,444 FEMALES 
AND 3,238 MALES. I WISH TO COMMEND ALL STAKEHOLDERS 
WHO HAVE JOINED HANDS WITH GOVERNMENT IN OUR FIGHT 
AGAINST GENDER BASED VIOLENCE. 
16. TO SUPPORT VICTIMS AND EXPEDITIOUSLY DISPOSE OF 
GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE CASES, GOVERNMENT HAS 
CONTINUED ESTABLISHING ONE-STOP CENTRES AND USER- 
FRIENDLY FAST-TRACK COURTS. IN 2017, WE ONLY HAD TWO 
FAST TRACK COURTS SITUATED IN LUSAKA AND KABWE. AT 
THE END OF 2018, FOUR MORE COURTS WERE ESTABLISHED 
AND ARE OPERATIONAL IN CHIPATA, NDOLA, LIVINGSTONE 
AND MONGU. 
17. GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO ESTABLISH MORE ONE-STOP 
CENTRES AND FAST-TRACK COURTS. IT IS MY HOPE THAT 
WITH TIME THE INCIDENCES OF GENDER BASED VIOLENCE 
WILL BE REDUCED. I URGE OUR PEOPLE TO DESIST FROM 
ENGAGING IN GENDER BASED VIOLENCE. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
18. ANOTHER AREA OF CONCERN HAS BEEN ALCOHOL AND 
SUBSTANCE ABUSE, ESPECIALLY AMONG OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. 
TO CURB ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE, GOVERNMENT, 
AMONG OTHER MEASURES, UNDERTOOK SENSITISATION OF 
6 
TRADITIONAL AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS WHERE 235 CHIEFS 
AND 180 RELIGIOUS LEADERS FROM ALL THE TEN PROVINCES 
WERE SENSITISED ON THE DANGERS OF ALCOHOL AND 
SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THIS WAS WITH THE VIEW TO 
STRENGTHENING THEIR ROLE AS AGENTS OF CHANGE. THIS 
PROGRAMME WILL CONTINUE BECAUSE TRADITIONAL AND 
RELIGIOUS LEADERS PLAY A CARDINAL ROLE IN SHAPING THE 
MORALS OF OUR SOCIETY. 
19. FURTHER, GOVERNMENT UNDERTOOK 2,310 PUBLIC 
AWARENESS PROGRAMMES IN LEARNING INSTITUTIONS, WORK 
PLACES AND COMMUNITY-BASED STRUCTURES THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY. THESE PROGRAMMES, WHICH ARE ALSO BEING 
SUPPORTED BY CORPORATE ENTITIES, WILL CONTINUE. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
20. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE INFORMATION AND 
COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES TO ADVANCE AND PROPEL 
OUR COUNTRY TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT. IT IS OF 
GREAT CONCERN, HOWEVER, THAT OTHERS HAVE CHOSEN TO 
USE THIS VERSATILE TOOL TO COMMIT CYBER CRIMES THAT 
INCLUDE FINANCIAL MALPRACTICES, HATE SPEECH, 
FALSEHOODS AND CHARACTER ASSASSINATION. I, ONCE 
AGAIN, IMPLORE ALL OUR CITIZENS TO BE WARY OF THE 
7 
NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND USE THIS MEDIUM 
RESPONSIBLY. 
21. ON OUR PART AS GOVERNMENT, I AM GLAD TO REPORT 
THAT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS IN PROMOTING 
RESPONSIBLE USE OF ELECTRONIC PLATFORMS AS WELL AS 
SAFEGUARDING USERS ON THESE PLATFORMS. THE PROCESS 
OF ENACTING THE CYBER SECURITY AND CYBER CRIMES BILL 
AND THE DATA PROTECTION BILL HAS REACHED AN ADVANCED 
STAGE. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT OFFENDERS ARE BROUGHT 
TO BOOK. 
22. I URGE THIS AUGUST HOUSE TO SUPPORT THE BILLS 
WHICH WILL BE PRESENTED DURING THIS SESSION OF 
PARLIAMENT. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
23. OUR COUNTRY IS ALSO CHALLENGED ON THE MORAL 
FRONT BY THE INCIDENCES OF DEFILEMENT. DEFILEMENT IS 
AN INHUMAN ACT THAT DEPRIVES VICTIMS OF THEIR RIGHT 
TO LIVE DIGNIFIED LIVES. THE SCARS FROM BEING DEFILED 
HAVE LASTING NEGATIVE EFFECTS. IN THIS REGARD, 
GOVERNMENT AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS HAVE TAKEN STEPS 
TO RAISE AWARENESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. FURTHER, 
GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED FOR STIFFER PENALTIES TO 
8 
ELIMINATE THIS VICE. I IMPLORE FAMILIES AND 
COMMUNITIES TO ALSO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND SPEAK OUT 
AGAINST THIS VICE AS WELL AS HELP IN THE REHABILITATION 
OF VICTIMS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
24. TEENAGE PREGNANCY CONTINUES TO BE A GROWING 
CONCERN IN OUR COUNTRY. IT UNDERMINES THE RIGHTS OF 
GIRLS AND COMPROMISES THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY 
REALISE THEIR POTENTIAL. GOVERNMENT IS, THEREFORE, 
IMPLEMENTING MEASURES TO END TEENAGE PREGNANCY. I 
COMMEND THE EFFORTS OF OUR COOPERATING PARTNERS, 
CIVIL SOCIETY, TRADITIONAL LEADERS AND RELIGIOUS 
ORGANISATIONS IN THIS FIGHT. 
25. ONE SUCH MEASURE IS THE CONTINUED IMPLEMENTION 
OF THE ADOLESCENCE HEALTH STRATEGY. THROUGH THIS 
STRATEGY, 40 TRAINERS OF TRAINERS WERE TRAINED IN 
ADOLESCENT HEALTH IN 2018. FURTHER, 504 PEER 
EDUCATORS DRAWN FROM ALL THE TEN PROVINCES WERE 
TRAINED. IN ADDITION, 1,309,150 ADOLESCENTS WERE 
REACHED WITH HEALTH MESSAGES AND VARIOUS HEALTH AND 
SOCIAL SERVICES. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
9 
26. UPHOLDING MORAL UPRIGHTNESS AND ETHICAL 
CONDUCT BY ALL OUR PEOPLE IN BUSINESS, WORK AND 
SOCIAL LIFE IS KEY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS COUNTRY. 
DURING MY ADDRESS IN MARCH LAST YEAR, I INFORMED THIS 
HOUSE THAT GOVERNMENT HAD DEVELOPED CODES OF ETHICS 
TO REGULATE THE BEHAVIOUR OF PUBLIC SERVICE OFFICERS. 
27. I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THIS PROGRAMME HAS 
CONTINUED AND MORE PUBLIC SERVICE INSTITUTIONS HAVE 
DEVELOPED THEIR CODES OF ETHICS, WHICH ENCOMPASS 
SUCH IMPORTANT VALUES AS LOYALTY, HONESTY AND 
INTEGRITY. THE INSTITUTIONS INCLUDE THE ZAMBIA POLICE 
SERVICE, THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT AND THE ZAMBIA 
DEFENCE FORCES. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
28. TO PROMOTE ETHICAL CONDUCT AND PROFESSIONALISM, 
A TOTAL OF 3,100 OFFICERS FROM THE ZAMBIA POLICE 
SERVICE AND THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT AND 1,351 
TEACHERS WERE SENSITISED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE CODES OF 
ETHICS IN 2018. FURTHER, 5,984 CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES 
WERE SENSITISED ON THE CODE OF ETHICS FOR THE PUBLIC 
SERVICE. I WISH TO APPLAUD ALL PUBLIC SERVICE OFFICERS 
10 
WHO ARE SETTING A GOOD EXAMPLE IN ADHERING TO THESE 
CODES OF ETHICS. 
29. TO FURTHER UPHOLD MORAL AND ETHICAL CONDUCT, 
GOVERNMENT HAS STRENGTHENED THE OFFICE OF THE 
CHAPLAINCY IN THE ZAMBIA CORRECTIONAL SERVICE. ALL 
CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES NOW HAVE AT LEAST ONE 
QUALIFIED CHAPLAIN TO PROVIDE SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE ON 
MORAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES TO INMATES AND OFFICERS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
30. EXAMINATION MALPRACTICES HAVE REMAINED A 
CONCERN TO THE NATION AND ARE RETROGRESSIVE. 
PERPETRATORS OF THIS CRIME SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT 
THERE IS NO SHORT-CUT TO GENUINE SUCCESS. ONE OF THE 
RIPPLE EFFECTS IS THAT PEOPLE GET USED TO MALPRACTICE 
AND APPLY IT IN OTHER SPHERES OF LIFE, LEADING TO A 
GROWING NUMBER OF DECEITFUL PEOPLE IN SOCIETY. IN 
ADDITION, OUR INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING WILL PRODUCE A 
SUB-STANDARD HUMAN RESOURCE THAT CANNOT EFFECTIVELY 
RESPOND TO THE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY. 
31. I AM, THEREFORE, PLEASED TO INFORM THIS AUGUST 
HOUSE THAT GOVERNMENT HAS PUT IN PLACE MEASURES TO 
BRING THIS VICE TO AN END. 
11 
MR. SPEAKER, 
32. I WISH TO DRAW THE ATTENTION OF THIS AUGUST 
HOUSE TO THE MEDIA. THE MEDIA HAS A POWERFUL ROLE TO 
PLAY IN BUILDING OUR NATION WHICH GOES BEYOND 
INFORMING, EDUCATING AND ENTERTAINING. THEY HAVE A 
MAJOR INFLUENCE ON THE MORAL AND ETHICAL CONDUCT OF 
OUR PEOPLE. I, THEREFORE, WISH TO IMPLORE MEDIA 
HOUSES TO TAKE A LEAD IN PROMOTING MORAL AND ETHICAL 
LIVING AMONG OUR PEOPLE. THEY SHOULD BE SENSITIVE TO 
THEIR AUDIENCE AND ENSURE THAT THEIR CONTENT IS 
PROGRESSIVE AND NOT DESTRUCTIVE. 
PATRIOTISM AND NATIONAL UNITY 
MR. SPEAKER, 
33. PATRIOTISM ENTAILS A LIFELONG COMMITMENT BY EACH 
ONE OF US TOWARDS MAKING OUR COUNTRY A BETTER PLACE. 
WE SHOULD STRIVE TO WORK TOGETHER IN PURSUIT OF 
COMMON GOALS THAT SEEK TO BENEFIT OUR COUNTRY. THE 
CHALLENGES WE FACE AS A NATION CAN ONLY BE ADDRESSED 
IN UNITY. 
34. IT IS GRATIFYING TO NOTE THAT OUR CITIZENS ARE 
INCREASINGLY EMBRACING SELFLESS DEVOTION TO OUR 
12 
NATION. THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE SUPPORT GOVERNMENT 
IS RECEIVING FROM VARIOUS CITIZENS IN A NUMBER OF 
AREAS SUCH AS EPIDEMIC CONTROL, DISASTER MANAGEMENT 
AND CARING FOR THE UNDER-PRIVILEGED. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
35. UNDER THE PROUDLY ZAMBIAN CAMPAIGN, GOVERNMENT 
IS WORKING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO PROMOTE THE 
BUYING AND USE OF ZAMBIAN PRODUCTS. IF WE, AS 
ZAMBIANS, DO NOT STAND PROUD AND SUPPORT PRODUCTS 
FROM OUR OWN NATURAL RESOURCES, WHO WILL? WHO WILL 
CONSUME THE PRODUCTS FROM OUR LOCAL PRODUCERS? 
WHO WILL STIMULATE OUR INDUSTRIES TO GROW AND 
CREATE THE MUCH NEEDED JOBS? IT IS ONLY OURSELVES. 
THEREFORE, THINK LOCAL FIRST! 
36. TO PROMOTE LOCAL PRODUCTS, A ‘PROUDLY ZAMBIAN’ 
EXPO WAS SUCCESSFULLY HELD IN NOVEMBER 2018. THE 
EXPO ATTRACTED MORE THAN 50 ZAMBIAN PRODUCERS WHO 
SHOWCASED THEIR PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT OF THE EXPO, 
THE UPTAKE OF ZAMBIAN PRODUCTS IS EXPECTED TO 
INCREASE. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
13 
37. THERE IS NEED TO ENHANCE PATRIOTISM AMONG OUR 
LOCAL CONTRACTORS AS WELL. GOVERNMENT IS, THEREFORE, 
PROVIDING TRAINING TO LOCAL CONTRACTORS TO ENABLE 
THEM DELIVER HIGH QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS. THE 
TRAINING IS ALSO AIMED AT INCULCATING A SENSE OF 
PATRIOTISM. IN 2018, 1,920 CONTRACTORS WERE TRAINED. 
38. I ENCOURAGE OUR LOCAL CONTRACTORS TO EMBRACE 
THE CULTURE OF HARD WORK AND GOOD BUSINESS ETHICS. 
YOU MUST ALWAYS ENDEAVOUR TO DELIVER ON YOUR 
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS IF YOU HAVE TO WIN THE 
CONFIDENCE OF OUR PEOPLE. THIS WAY YOU WILL STOP 
COMPLAINING OF BEING SIDE-LINED IN PREFERENCE TO 
FOREIGN CONTRACTORS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
39. GOVERNMENT HAS INVESTED HEAVILY IN VARIOUS 
INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR ACCELERATED 
DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVED LIVELIHOODS OF OUR PEOPLE. 
IT IS EVERYONE’S DUTY TO SAFEGUARD THIS 
INFRASTRUCTURE. 
40. WE MUST, THEREFORE, SAY NO TO VANDALISM AND 
DEVELOP A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND PRIDE TOWARDS 
THESE NATIONAL ASSETS. FROM THAT PUPIL IN KASHIKISHI, 
14 
TO THE HEALTH WORKER IN MITETE, AND TO OUR YOUTH ON 
THE STREETS AND HIGHWAYS OF OUR COUNTRY, WE HAVE A 
COLLECTIVE DUTY TO PROTECT THESE ASSETS AND GUARD 
THEM JEALOUSLY. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
41. PATRIOTISM DEMANDS THAT WE ALWAYS SPEAK WELL OF 
OUR COUNTRY. LET US BE THE BEST AMBASSADORS OF OUR 
MOTHERLAND AT HOME AND ABROAD. I CANNOT EMPHASISE 
THIS POINT ENOUGH. FELLOW ZAMBIANS, LET US BE PROUD 
OF OUR LAND, OUR IDENTITY, OUR HOME. WE MAY NOT ALL 
APPRECIATE HOW IT FEELS TO HAVE NO SENSE OF 
BELONGING. THEREFORE, LET US STAND PROUD OF OUR 
MOTHERLAND. INDEED, STAND AND SING OF ZAMBIA 
PROUD AND FREE. 
MR SPEAKER, 
42. IN AN EFFORT TO FOSTER NATIONAL UNITY, IDENTITY 
AND SOVEREIGNTY, GOVERNMENT HAS CONTINUED TO 
FACILITATE THE COMMEMORATION OF NATIONAL DAYS OF 
HISTORIC IMPORTANCE. THESE INCLUDE THE INDEPENDENCE 
15 
DAY, AFRICA FREEDOM DAY AND NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER, 
FASTING, REPENTANCE AND RECONCILIATION. 
43. THE COMMEMORATIONS REMIND US OF OUR RICH 
HISTORY AS A COUNTRY, AND IN SOME CASES, THE 
CONTRIBUTION MADE BY OUR FORE-FATHERS AND MOTHERS. 
THE OBSERVANCE OF THESE DAYS ALSO HELP US TO 
CELEBRATE OUR UNITY IN DIVERSITY. I, THEREFORE, URGE 
ALL CITIZENS TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THESE IMPORTANT 
EVENTS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
44. FURTHER, WHAT EQUALLY DEFINES OUR PATRIOTISM AND 
NATIONAL UNITY ARE OUR NATIONAL SYMBOLS. GOVERNMENT 
IS PROMOTING THE ENTRENCHMENT OF OUR NATIONAL 
SYMBOLS, THESE BEING THE NATIONAL FLAG, THE NATIONAL 
ANTHEM, THE COAT OF ARMS, THE NATIONAL MOTTO AND THE 
PUBLIC SEAL. 
45. STAKEHOLDER SENSITISATION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF 
RESPECTING THE NATIONAL SYMBOLS CONTINUES TO BE 
UNDERTAKEN. WE MUST CONTINUE TO EDUCATE OUR 
CHILDREN AT HOME, IN SCHOOLS AND AT SOCIAL 
GATHERINGS, ON THE TRUE MEANING OF THESE SYMBOLS. 
16 
THE SYMBOLS MUST BE ENGRAVED IN OUR MINDS AND HEARTS 
TO HELP US BE MORE PATRIOTIC. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
46. TO FURTHER ENHANCE NATIONAL UNITY, WE NEED TO 
ENGAGE AND COMMUNICATE GENUINELY AS A PEOPLE. WE 
NEED TO EMBRACE A SPIRIT OF CONSTRUCTIVE AND 
PROGRESSIVE DIALOGUE AT ALL LEVELS. AS GOVERNMENT, 
WE WILL NOT RELENT ON THIS. OUR CITIZENS MUST ALSO 
PLAY THEIR PART IN PROMOTING NATIONAL UNITY. 
DEMOCRACY AND CONSTITUTIONALISM 
MR. SPEAKER, 
47. AS A DEMOCRACY, WE AS GOVERNMENT GOVERN WITH 
THE AUTHORITY AND VOICE OF THE PEOPLE. THEREFORE, WE 
REMAIN COMMITTED TO PROMOTING THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS 
TO PARTICIPATE IN RUNNING THE AFFAIRS OF OUR COUNTRY. 
WE ARE EQUALLY COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING THE SUPREMACY 
OF THE CONSTITUTION FOR THE WELL-BEING OF ALL 
ZAMBIANS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
17 
48. GOVERNMENT IS COGNISANT OF THE FACT THAT CIVIC 
EDUCATION IS A CRUCIAL ELEMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC 
DISPENSATION OF THE COUNTRY. ONE CRITICAL AREA IN THIS 
REGARD IS VOTER EDUCATION. GOVERNMENT IN 
COLLABORATION WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS HAS BEEN 
UNDERTAKING CONTINUOUS VOTER SENSITISATION 
COUNTRYWIDE. 
49. IN 2018, GOVERNMENT CONDUCTED A TOTAL OF 27 
VOTER SENSITISATION ACTIVITIES IN DISTRICTS THAT HAD 
BY-ELECTIONS AS WELL AS VARIOUS VOTER EDUCATION 
OUTREACH ACTIVITIES IN SELECTED DISTRICTS. IT IS 
EXPECTED THAT VOTER TURN OUT WILL PROGRESSIVELY 
IMPROVE, ESPECIALLY DURING BY-ELECTIONS AND FURTHER, 
TOWARDS GENERAL ELECTIONS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
50. NECESSARY CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS ARE VITAL IN THE 
LIFE OF ANY DEMOCRATIC NATION SUCH AS OURS. 
GOVERNMENT ALSO REMAINS COMMITTED TO CONTINUE 
UNDERTAKING CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IN LINE WITH THE 
ASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
18 
51. POLITICAL VIOLENCE THREATENS OUR NATIONAL UNITY 
AND DEMOCRACY. POLITICAL VIOLENCE RESULTS IN INJURIES 
AND FATALITIES AS WELL AS DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY. IT 
ALSO ROBS OUR PEOPLE OF THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE FREELY. 
FURTHER, SUCH ACTIONS DENT THE IMAGE OF OUR COUNTRY 
WHICH IS KNOWN AS A BEACON OF PEACE. 
52. I, THEREFORE, WISH TO, ONCE AGAIN, CONDEMN ALL 
FORMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN THE STRONGEST TERMS. 
WE NEED TO PROMOTE CO-EXISTENCE AND ACCOMMODATE 
DIVERGENT VIEWS. WE NEED TO STRIVE TO RESOLVE OUR 
DIFFERENCES THROUGH NON-VIOLENT MEANS. LET US 
CONTINUE TO PROMOTE OUR MOTTO OF ONE ZAMBIA, ONE 
NATION. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
53. LET ME REMIND ALL OUR CITIZENS THAT NO ONE IS 
ABOVE THE LAW. ALL PERPETRATORS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE 
SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO BOOK REGARDLESS OF THEIR 
POLITICAL AFFILIATION. THE ZAMBIA POLICE SERVICE 
SHOULD, THEREFORE, DEAL WITH ALL MATTERS OF POLITICAL 
VIOLENCE IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER. 
HUMAN DIGNITY, EQUITY, SOCIAL JUSTICE, EQUALITY 
AND NON-DISCRIMINATION 
19 
MR. SPEAKER, 
54. EVERY HUMAN BEING IS BORN WITH THE RIGHT TO 
DIGNITY AND FAIR TREATMENT. AS GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE A 
DUTY TO ENSURE THAT ALL OUR CITIZENS ARE TREATED WITH 
DIGNITY AND FAIRNESS. 
55. TO PROMOTE THE DIGNITY OF OUR WORKERS, 
GOVERNMENT, IN SEPTEMBER 2018, REVISED THE MINIMUM 
WAGE FOR DOMESTIC, SHOP AND GENERAL WORKERS. FOR 
INSTANCE, BANA BWALYA, A DOMESTIC WORKER, WHO WAS 
PREVIOUSLY EARNING K520.00 IS NOW GETTING K993.60. 
HER NEIGHBOUR, MISOZI, A SHOP KEEPER, WHO WAS TAKING 
HOME K1,100.00 IN 2017 IS NOW EARNING AT LEAST 
K1,600.00. 
56. I URGE ALL EMPLOYERS TO ADHERE TO THE REVISED 
MINIMUM WAGE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN THE 
DIGNITY OF OUR PROTECTED WORKFORCE. LET US REMEMBER 
THAT HUMAN RESOURCE IS THE MOST VALUABLE ASSET FOR 
ANY ORGANISATION. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
57. OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS HAVE 
NOT BEEN LEFT OUT. IN 2018, GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE 
20 
STREET CHILDREN PROGRAMME, PROVIDED SOCIAL SUPPORT 
AND REHABILITATION SERVICES TO 1,350 STREET CHILDREN 
CONSISTING OF 1,215 BOYS AND 135 GIRLS. 
58. LET ME THANK THE COOPERATING PARTNERS AND CIVIL 
SOCIETY FOR COMPLEMENTING GOVERNMENT EFFORTS IN 
REHABILITATING AND RE-INTEGRATING THE CHILDREN BACK 
INTO THEIR FAMILIES. AS FAMILIES, LET US ALSO ENSURE 
THAT WE PLAY OUR PARENTAL AND GUARDIAN ROLE TO AVOID 
LETTING OUR CHILDREN ROAM THE STREETS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
59. IN A BID TO PROMOTE EQUITY FOR ALL OUR CITIZENS, 
GOVERNMENT HAS CONTINUED TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO 
SOCIAL SERVICES FOR OUR PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL 
AREAS. 
60. FOR INSTANCE, TO PROVIDE QUALITY HEALTH SERVICES 
AS CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE, GOVERNMENT HAS 
CONTINUED TO REHABILITATE, UPGRADE AND CONSTRUCT 
NEW HEALTH FACILITIES COUNTRYWIDE. IN THIS VEIN, TWO 
ADDITIONAL FIRST LEVEL HOSPITALS WERE COMPLETED IN 
2018 AND ARE OPERATIONAL IN CHIPATA AND NYIMBA. THE 
21 
CONSTRUCTION OF 14 HEALTH POSTS WAS COMPLETED, 
BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER TO 289. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
61. TO PROMOTE EQUITY IN ACCESS TO EDUCATION, 
ESPECIALLY BY GIRLS FROM VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS, 
GOVERNMENT IS IMPLEMENTING THE “KEEPING GIRLS IN 
SCHOOL” PROGRAMME. IN 2018, A TOTAL OF 16,162 GIRLS 
WERE SUPPORTED WITH SCHOOL FEES AGAINST A TARGET OF 
14,000. THIS WAS AN IMPROVEMENT IN COMPARISON TO 
2017 WHEN 8,818 GIRLS WERE SUPPORTED IN 16 DISTRICTS. 
THIS IS COMMENDABLE. GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO UPSCALE 
THIS PROGRAMME TO COVER 11 ADDITIONAL DISTRICTS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
62. TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN URBAN AND 
RURAL AREAS, GOVERNMENT COMPLETED THE CONSTRUCTION 
OF 623 COMMUNICATION TOWERS IN UNSERVED AND UNDER- 
SERVED AREAS IN 2018. OUT OF THESE TOWERS, 338 ARE 
ALREADY FUNCTIONAL. THE REMAINING TOWERS WILL BE 
OPERATIONAL BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. 
63. THIS CONTINUES TO EASE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND 
COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY FOR PEOPLE IN RURAL 
22 
AREAS, CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY 
AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. I AM SURE THAT MANY OF US 
ARE APPRECIATING THE ABILITY TO REACH FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS REGARDLESS OF THEIR LOCATIONS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
64. GOVERNMENT IS AWARE THAT SOME RURAL AREAS HAVE 
REMAINED UNDER-SERVED IN RESPECT OF RADIO AND 
TELEVISION SIGNALS. I AM, HOWEVER, GLAD TO REPORT 
THAT 18 OF THE 25 NEW RADIO STATION LICENCES 
APPROVED IN 2018, WERE FOR THE RURAL AREAS. OUR 
PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS WILL NOW HAVE INCREASED ACCESS 
TO INFORMATION TO HELP THEM MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
65. IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO LEGAL 
REPRESENTATION, A TOTAL OF 4,509 VULNERABLE PEOPLE 
WHO SOUGHT ASSISTANCE WERE ALL SUPPORTED WITH LEGAL 
AID SERVICES ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN 2018. 
66. FURTHER, TO STRENGTHEN THE POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR 
THE PROVISION OF LEGAL AID SERVICES, GOVERNMENT, IN 
NOVEMBER 2018, LAUNCHED THE NATIONAL LEGAL AID 
POLICY. THE POLICY WILL, AMONG OTHERS, PROMOTE 
23 
IMPARTIALITY, FAIRNESS AND INCLUSIVENESS IN LEGAL 
REPRESENTATION. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
67. OUR PEOPLE DESERVE FAIR AND JUST DISTRIBUTION OF 
WEALTH, OPPORTUNITIES AND SOCIAL PRIVILEGES. IN THIS 
REGARD, 1,077 BOREHOLES WERE CONSTRUCTED IN RURAL 
AREAS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN 2018. APPROXIMATELY 
269,250 INDIVIDUALS ARE NOW ABLE TO ACCESS CLEAN AND 
SAFE WATER FROM THESE BOREHOLES. THIS IS REDUCING 
THE INCIDENCES OF WATER-BORNE DISEASES. 
68. IN ADDITION, CHIKOWA DAM WAS CONSTRUCTED IN 
MAMBWE DISTRICT IN EASTERN PROVINCE WHILE 5 DAMS IN 
LUAPULA, NORTH-WESTERN, COPPERBELT, SOUTHERN AND 
WESTERN PROVINCES ARE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF 
CONSTRUCTION. FURTHER, 2 DAMS IN ZIMBA DISTRICT IN 
SOUTHERN PROVINCE WERE REHABILITATED. THESE DAMS 
WILL INSPIRE OUR PEOPLE IN THE SURROUNDING 
COMMUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES SUCH AS 
FISH FARMING, HORTICULTURE, AND RAISING LIVESTOCK. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
24 
69. GOVERNMENT HAS CONTINUED WITH THE PROGRAMME 
OF CONNECTING DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO THE 
NATIONAL ELECTRICITY GRID. IN 2018, GOVERNMENT 
CONNECTED 36 RURAL GROWTH CENTRES IN NINE DISTRICTS 
IN FIVE PROVINCES TO THE NATIONAL GRID THROUGH THE 
RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROGRAMME. IN TOTAL, 2,497 
CUSTOMERS WERE CONNECTED TO THE NATIONAL GRID. 
70. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR, WE 
CONNECTED 300 HOUSEHOLDS TO A 50 KILOWATT SOLAR 
MINI-GRID IN CHIPANGALI DISTRICT OF EASTERN PROVINCE. 
IN LUSAKA PROVINCE, 150 HOUSEHOLDS OF CHIRUNDU 
DISTRICT WERE CONNECTED TO A 10.2 KILOWATT SOLAR 
MICRO-GRID. 
71. GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE WITH THE RURAL 
ELECTRIFICATION PROGRAMME TO ENABLE MORE OF OUR 
PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY ACCESS ELECTRICITY AND 
IMPROVE THEIR LIVELIHOODS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
72. WE ARE ALSO WORKING HARD TO PROMOTE EQUALITY IN 
OUR DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO LAND, 
GOVERNMENT HAS CONTINUED TO IMPLEMENT THE 
DELIBERATE POLICY TO ALLOCATE 40 PERCENT OF AVAILABLE 
25 
LAND TO WOMEN WHILST THE REMAINING 60 PERCENT IS 
COMPETED FOR BY BOTH MEN AND WOMEN. FOR INSTANCE, 
IN 2018, 3,010 CERTIFICATES OF TITLE WERE PROCESSED 
FOR WOMEN COMPARED TO 7,063 FOR MEN IN AN EFFORT TO 
REACH THE 40 PERCENT TARGET. THIS CLEARLY 
DEMONSTRATES THAT WE ARE MAKING CONSIDERABLE 
PROGRESS TOWARDS EMPOWERING WOMEN. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
73. IN OUR QUEST TO ELIMINATE ALL FORMS OF 
DISCRIMINATION IN THE DELIVERY OF DEVELOPMENT, 
GOVERNMENT IS RESOLVED TO ENSURING THAT 
IMPLEMENTATION OF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES TAKES 
INTO ACCOUNT THE SPECIAL NEEDS AND CAPACITIES OF ITS 
PEOPLE. 
74. TO DEMONSTRATE THIS, GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE 
TEACHER RECRUITMENT EXERCISE OF 2018, RESERVED TEN 
PER CENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POSITIONS FOR PERSONS 
WITH DISABILITIES. I, THEREFORE, URGE OTHER 
INSTITUTIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO 
EMULATE THIS DELIBERATE POLICY. LET US ENSURE THAT 
EVERY ZAMBIAN IS TREATED WITH DIGNITY. 
GOOD GOVERNANCE AND INTEGRITY 
26 
MR. SPEAKER, 
75. GOOD GOVERNANCE ENTAILS COLLECTIVE DECISION- 
MAKING, ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN RUNNING 
THE AFFAIRS OF THE COUNTRY. IT IS, THEREFORE, 
IMPERATIVE THAT OUR PEOPLE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE 
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND POLITICAL PROCESSES 
THAT AFFECT THEIR DAILY LIVES. 
76. TO THIS EFFECT, WE HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO INVOLVE 
OUR PEOPLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GOVERNMENT POLICY 
AND LEGISLATION. FOR INSTANCE, IN 2018, OUR CITIZENS 
WERE CONSULTED DURING THE FORMULATION OF THE 
INDUSTRIAL POLICY, THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL 
ORGANISATIONS POLICY, THE HERITAGE AND CONSERVATION 
POLICY, AND THE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE ACT NO. 2 OF 
2018. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
77. WE ARE ALSO MAKING PROGRESS IN ENHANCING 
INTEGRITY IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE. IN MY ADDRESS TO THIS 
AUGUST HOUSE IN MARCH 2018, I REPORTED THAT 
GOVERNMENT WOULD BRING THE PUBLIC FINANCE 
MANAGEMENT BILL FOR CONSIDERATION BY THIS AUGUST 
HOUSE. I AM GLAD TO REPORT THAT THIS BILL WAS ENACTED 
27 
IN APRIL 2018. THE PUBLIC FINANCE MANAGEMENT ACT NO. 1 
OF 2018 IS NOW INSTRUMENTAL IN ENHANCING 
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE USE OF PUBLIC 
FUNDS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
78. GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THE IMPORTANT ROLE CIVIL 
SOCIETY PLAYS IN PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE. IN THIS 
REGARD, WE CONTINUED PROVIDING A CONDUCIVE 
ENVIRONMENT FOR CIVIL SOCIETY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 
GOVERNANCE OF THE COUNTRY. 
79. IN 2018, ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CIVIL SOCIETY 
ORGANISATIONS WERE REGISTERED, BRINGING THE TOTAL 
NUMBER OF ACTIVE CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS, WORKING 
IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF OUR COUNTRY, TO 906. 
80. I URGE ALL CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS TO CONTINUE 
RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS AND ASPIRATIONS OF OUR 
PEOPLE IN THEIR AREAS OF FOCUS WITHIN THE CONFINES OF 
THE LAW. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
81. GOVERNMENT REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE FIGHT 
AGAINST CORRUPTION. CORRUPTION STARVES VITAL 
28 
DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMMES OF THE MUCH NEEDED 
RESOURCES. IT IS AN EVIL THAT UNNECESSARILY INFLATES 
THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND ERODES INVESTOR 
CONFIDENCE IN THE ECONOMY. 
82. I, THEREFORE, WISH TO URGE ALL THE RELEVANT 
AGENCIES MANDATED TO COMBAT CORRUPTION TO STEP UP 
THE FIGHT. I IMPLORE YOU TO TACKLE THE VICE IN ALL ITS 
FORMS. AS I HAVE STATED BEFORE, WE WILL NOT INTERFERE 
IN YOUR OPERATIONS. WE STAND READY TO SUPPORT YOU IN 
THIS NOBLE CAUSE. WE WILL CAPACITATE YOU TO 
EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE YOUR MANDATE. 
83. TO MY FELLOW CITIZENS, I WISH TO URGE YOU TO 
DETEST THIS VICE. I INVITE YOU TO THE BATTLE FRONT. DO 
NOT ABATE CORRUPTION. REPORT ALL CASES OF CORRUPTION 
TO RELEVENT AUTHORITIES. TOGETHER, LET US WAGE A 
COURAGEOUS AND RELENTLESS FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION. 
THIS IS A WAR WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE. WE OWE 
VICTORY IN THIS WAR TO POSTERITY. 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
MR. SPEAKER, 
29 
84. IN OUR RESOLVE TO ACHIEVE SOCIO-ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PRESENT, WE ARE MINDFUL OF THE 
NEEDS OF FUTURE GENERATIONS. 
85. IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPERATIVE THAT AS A NATION, WE 
RESPOND TO THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE 
BY IMPROVING THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR NATURAL 
RESOURCES. GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTATING 
CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION MEASURES. 
86. THESE INCLUDE AFFORESTATION AND REFORESTATION, 
CONSERVATION FARMING, PROMOTION OF GREEN ENERGY AS 
WELL AS SAFEGUARDING AND IMPROVING OUR ENVIRONMENT 
THROUGH EFFECTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT. FOR INSTANCE IN 
2018, TREES WERE PLANTED ON 3,951 HECTARES OF LAND. 
FURTHERMORE, 15,509 HECTARES OF LAND WAS ALLOCATED 
FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMUNITY FORESTS IN 5 SITES 
OF MPULUNGU DISTRICT. 
87. SIMILARLY, 10,542 FRUIT TREES, 24,854 EXOTIC TREES 
AND 60,000 VETIVER GRASS WERE PLANTED. IN ADDITION, 
STATUTORY INSTRUMENT NO. 11 OF 2018 WAS ISSUED TO 
ENHANCE COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN FOREST 
MANAGEMENT. THIS HAS SO FAR RESULTED IN THE SIGNING 
OF 21 FOREST MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS COVERING A TOTAL 
30 
FOREST AREA OF 32,730 HECTARES OF LAND IN MUCHINGA 
AND NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
88. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IS MORE PRONE TO THE 
EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAN OTHER SECTORS. IN THIS 
REGARD, GOVERNMENT IS PROMOTING CONSERVATION 
AGRICULTURE TO ENHANCE CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE 
AMONG AGRICULTURAL HOUSEHOLDS. OVER THE LAST TWO 
FARMING SEASONS, A TOTAL OF 267,000 FARMERS HAVE 
ADOPTED CONSERVATION AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES 
COUNTRYWIDE. 
89. FURTHER, GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN UNDERTAKING 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO COME UP WITH DROUGHT 
RESISTANT CROP VARIETIES AND CONTRIBUTE TO CROP 
DIVERSIFICATION. IN THIS REGARD, A TOTAL OF 13 NEW 
CROP VARIETIES WERE RELEASED ONTO THE MARKET IN 2018. 
MR. SPEAKER 
90. GOVERNMENT IS ALIVE TO THE DANGERS POSED BY THE 
INDISCRIMINATE DISPOSAL OF PLASTICS TO THE 
ENVIRONMENT, WHICH IS ALSO A HEALTH HAZARD TO OUR 
SOCIETY. IT IS, THEREFORE, EVERYONE’S RESPONSIBILITY TO 
31 
ENSURE THAT OUR ENVIRONMENT IS PROTECTED BY ACTING 
RESPONSIBLY. 
91. WE ALL NEED TO CONTINUOUSLY SENSITISE THE 
CITIZENRY ON REDUCING, RE-USING AND RECYCLING OF 
PLASTIC PRODUCTS. THIS IS CRITICAL TO MITIGATING THE 
NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE PRODUCTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. 
92. TO ENHANCE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
MANAGEMENT ACT NO. 12 OF 2011, GOVERNMENT 
INTRODUCED A PARTIAL BAN ON THE USE OF PLASTICS 
THROUGH STATUTORY INSTRUMENT NO. 65 OF 2018 ON 
EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY. 
93. I, THEREFORE, URGE ALL OF US TO CHANGE OUR 
ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE USE AND DISPOSAL OF PLASTIC 
PRODUCTS. LET US GO BACK TO USING ENVIRONMENTALLY 
FRIENDLY PACKAGING MATERIALS SUCH AS PAPER BAGS AND 
RE-USABLE BASKETS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
94. FOLLOWING THE FORMULATION OF THE SOLID WASTE 
MANAGEMENT POLICY, WHICH I STATED IN MY PREVIOUS 
ADDRESS, WE HAVE SINCE ENACTED THE SOLID WASTE 
REGULATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT NO. 20 OF 2018. THE 
32 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS ACT WILL IMPROVE THE HANDLING 
AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID WASTE. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
95. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ALSO REQUIRES THAT OLD 
AND DILAPIDATED INFRASTRUCTURE IS EITHER REPAIRED OR 
DEMOLISHED AND THEN “BUILT BACK BETTER”. I, THEREFORE, 
URGE CITIZENS AND INSTITUTIONS TO EMBRACE THE 
CONCEPT OF URBAN-REGENERATION IN THE CONTEXT OF 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. 
96. I FURTHER URGE ALL CITIZENS TO CONTINUE PLAYING 
THEIR PART IN SAFEGUARDING OUR ENVIRONMENT AND 
NATURAL RESOURCES. LET US BE RESPONSIBLE IN THE 
MANNER WE USE OUR WATER AND ELECTRICITY. WE SHOULD 
ALSO BE MINDFUL OF HOW WE DISPOSE OFF WASTE. 
MONITORING PROGRESS 
MR. SPEAKER, 
97. DURING MY ADDRESS IN MARCH 2017, I INFORMED THIS 
HOUSE THAT GOVERNMENT WOULD DEVELOP A NATIONAL 
FRAMEWORK TO ASSIST IN GATHERING EVIDENCE IN THE 
APPLICATION OF NATIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES AT 
33 
NATIONAL, ORGANISATIONAL, COMMUNITY AND INDIVIDUAL 
LEVELS. 
98. I AM GLAD TO INFORM THIS AUGUST HOUSE THAT THIS 
FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. THE FRAMEWORK ALSO 
PROVIDES A COORDINATION MECHANISM AMONG VARIOUS 
INSTITUTIONS TO FACILITATE COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING 
AND TRACKING OF PROGRESS ON THE APPLICATION OF THE 
NATIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES. 
CONCLUSION 
MR. SPEAKER, 
99. IT IS, INDEED, ENCOURAGING THAT WE ARE MAKING 
STRIDES IN THE APPLICATION OF OUR NATIONAL VALUES AND 
PRINCIPLES. THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE PROGRESS WHICH I 
HAVE HIGHLIGHTED TODAY. HOWEVER, A LOT MORE STILL 
NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENTRENCH OUR NATIONAL VALUES AND 
PRINCIPLES IN WHATEVER WE DO, BE IT IN OUR HOMES, OUR 
SCHOOLS, OUR WORKPLACES AND INDEED IN OUR 
COMMUNITIES. WE MUST REMAIN COMMITTED TO WHAT WE 
HAVE SET FOR OURSELVES. 
100. ON THE PART OF GOVERNMENT, WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
PROVIDE LEADERSHIP AND AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT TO 
34 
FACILITATE THE APPRECIATION AND APPLICATION OF THESE 
VALUES AND PRINCIPLES. I IMPLORE OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO 
CONTINUE COMPLEMENTING OUR EFFORTS IN THE 
PROMOTION OF OUR NATIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
101. LET ME REITERATE THAT, COMMITMENT TO THE 
APPLICATION OF THE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES PROVIDES A 
SOLID BASE IN OUR JOURNEY TO PROSPERITY. THE 
INCULCATION OF THESE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES WILL 
ENSURE THAT, AS A PEOPLE, WE DEVELOP A DEEP SENSE OF 
SELF-WORTH AS WELL AS BUILD A POSITIVE IMAGE NECESSARY 
TO MOVE THIS COUNTRY TO GREATER HEIGHTS. 
MR. SPEAKER, 
102. TO ACHIEVE THIS, LET US RENEW OUR QUEST TO NOT 
ONLY CONTROL THE ECONOMY, BUT TO GROW IT. AM CALLING 
UPON ALL ZAMBIANS TO WORK HARD TO MOVE THIS COUNTRY 
TO GREATER HEIGHTS, TO OWN AND RUN BUSINESSES, OWN 
PROPERTY WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING LEBELED A SATANIST OR 
WITCH HUNTED FOR YOUR INOVATIONS. 
35 
MR. SPEAKER, 
103. LET OUR CONSCIENCE CONTINUE TO BE THE LIGHT OF 
THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. LET OUR CONSCIENCE GUIDE OUR 
ACTIONS IN BOTH OUR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIVES. LET OUR 
CONSCIENCE RAISE ITS VOICE IN PROTEST AND COUNSEL 
WHENEVER WE THINK OR BEHAVE CONTRARY TO OUR 
NATIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPES. 
MR. SPEAKER, I THANK YOU.
