I AM DELIGHTED AND GREATLY HONOURED TO LAUNCH THE MARKET COMMUNITY HEALTH INITIATIVE TODAY. THE INITIATIVE IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN ZAMBIA AND AN INDICATION OF THE PATRIOTIC FRONT GOVERNMENT’S COMMITMENT TO DELIVER MORE OF SUCH DEVELOPMENT TO OUR PEOPLE. 
THIS INITIATVE BEING LAUNCHED TODAY AT THE NEW SOWETO MARKET IN LUSAKA DISTRICT IS ALSO A DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT YOUR GOVERNMENT, THE PF GOVERNMENT ENVISAGES TO IMPLEMENT COUNTRYWIDE WITHIN THE VICINITY OF MARKETS, BUS STATIONS AND OTHER CONGREGATE SETTINGS.

MY GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO RECOGNISE THAT GOOD HEALTH AND WELLBEING IS A KEY INVESTMENT FOR OUR COUNTRY’S SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHICH SHOULD BE BASED ON THE NEEDS OUR PEOPLE AND NOT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. 
THE PATRIOTIC FRONT GOVERNMENT REMAINS COMMITTED IN LINE WITH OUR PARTY MANIFESTO TO ATTAIN ZAMBIA’S GOAL OF A PROSPEROUS MIDDLE- INCOME COUNTRY BY 2030, AS ESPOUSED IN OUR VISION 2030, AND ECHOED BOTH IN THE 7TH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN, AND THE NATIONAL HEALTH STRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2021. 
FOR US TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE NEED A NATION OF HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE. 
WE CANNOT ADDRESS SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT ISSUES WITHOUT ENSURING A HEALTHY POPULATION WHICH ANCHORS PRODUCTIVITY ACROSS ALL SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY. 
THIS IS WHY AS GOVERNMENT WE HAVE EMBARKED ON A TRANSFORMATION AGENDA OF ATTAINING UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE USING AN INTERGRATED COMMUNITY-BASED PRIMARY HEALTH CARE APPROACH. THEREFORE, TODAY’S LAUNCH OF THE MARKET COMMUNITY HEALTH INITIATIVE IS A CLEAR TESTIMONY TO THIS. 
OUR PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE PRODUCTIVE AGE GROUP ARE PREMATURELY DYING FROM PREVENTABLE COMMUNICABLE AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES DUE TO DELAYS IN ACCESSING HEALTH SERVICES.

DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
THIS SITUATION CALLS FOR AN URGENT NEED FOR US TO BE INNOVATIVE AND TAKE HEALTH SERVICES CLOSER TO WHERE OUR PEOPLE ARE, BE IT TO HOUSEHOLDS OR INDEED OTHER CONGREGATE SETTINGS SUCH AS MARKETS AND BUS STATIONS AS WE ARE WITNESSING TODAY. 
TODAY, TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF ALL DEATHS IN ZAMBIA ARE DUE TO PREVENTABLE NON COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. THIS MUST BE CURTAILED, AND AS LONG I AM PRESIDENT, I WILL ENSURE THAT EVERYTHING POSSIBLE IS DONE TO ADDRESS THE MATTER. 
THE MARKET COMMUNITY HEALTH INITIATIVE BEING LAUNCHED TODAY WILL PROVIDE A CONTEMPORARY MODEL FOR ADDRESSING HEALTH SERVICE PROVISION ACROSS THE CONTINUM OF CARE IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS SUCH AS MARKETS AND BUS STATIONS AMONG OTHERS, LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND. 
THIS INITITIATIVE IS AIMED AT SERVING OUR CITIZENS WHO MAY BE FACING DIFFICULTIES IN ACCESSING PROMOTIVE, PREVENTIVE AND BASIC CURATIVE HEALTH SERVICES BECAUSE OF THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES AS A RESULT OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT IN VARIOUS ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES.

AS YOUR CARING GOVERNMENT, WE UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY WELL THE CHALLENGES OUR PEOPLE ESPECIALLY OUR WOMEN TRADERS, GO THROUGH TO ACCESS HEALTH SERVICES WHICH ARE DISTANT FROM THEIR TRADING PLACES. 
IN THIS REGARD, WE HAVE COME UP WITH THIS INITIATIVE TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TRADERS AND SHOPPERS AND ALL THOSE IN THIS CONGREGATE SETTING TO EASILY ACCESS HEALTH SERVICES AT THEIR CONVENIENCE. 
TO THIS EFFECT, I DIRECT THE MINISTER OF HEALTH, THE MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND MINISTER OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOUSING TO EXPEDITE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH FACILITIES AT BIG MARKETS AND BUS STATIONS COUNTRYWIDE. DOING SO, WILL ENABLE MORE OF PEOPLE TO ACCESS THE MUCH NEEDED HEALTH SERVICES ESPECIALLY THOSE BUSY TRADING IN THESE CONGREGATE SETTINGS. 
I FURTHER DIRECT THE MINISTER OF HEALTH TO ENSURE THAT MORE COMMUNITY HEALTH FACILITIES ARE OPENED TO ENABLE MEN ACCESS HEALTH SERVICES AS THEY ARE RELUCTANT TO SEEK HEALTH SERVICES UNTIL ITS LATE. 
TODAY, WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE MEN PRESENTING IN OUR CLINICS AND HOSPITALS WITH ADVANCED COMMUNICABLE AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. WE CAN NOT ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE.

I WISH TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL TO THE CORPORATE WORLD AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO PARTNER WITH THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH IN ENSURING THAT HEALTH SERVICES ARE TAKEN TO THE DOORSTEPS OF OUR PEOPLE. THIS INCLUDES HOUSEHOLDS, WORK PLACES, PLACES OF WORSHIP, TRADING PLACES INCLUDING MARKETS, BUS STATIONS AMONG OTHERS. 
AS I CONCLUDE, I WISH TO COMMEND THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND THE ZAMBIA NATIONAL MARKETEERS CREDIT ASSOCIATION (ZANAMACA); THE COMMUTERS RIGHTS ASSOCIATION OF ZAMBIA (CRAZ), AND THE ORGANISED VENDORS AND TRADERS ASSOCIATION (OVERTRANS) FOR WORKING TOGETHER TO ENSURE THE FRUITION OF THIS FACILITY. 
LET ME ALSO EXTEND GRATITUDE ON BEHALF OF THE ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE OF ZAMBIA AND INDEED ON MY OWN BEHALF, TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR ITS CONTINUED SUPPORT TOWARDS IMPROVEMENT OF ZAMBIA’S HEALTH SECTOR. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING MANY MORE OF SUCH FACILITIES ACROSS THE NATION. LET’S ALL RISE TO THE OCCASION AND ENSURE A HEALTHIER ZAMBIA, LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND. 
IT IS NOW MY HONOUR AND PRIVILEGE TO OFFICIALLY LAUNCH THE ZAMBIA MARKET COMMUNITY HEALTH INITIATIVE AND COMMISSION ZAMBIA’S FIRST EVER COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC HERE AT NEW SOWETO MARKET. I THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU ALL.
