THIS IS A GREAT MILESTONE IN THE ACTUALISATION OF THE PATRIOTIC FRONT GOVERNMENT’S PRO-POOR POLICY AIMED AT ENSURING THAT THE LIVES OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR PEOPLE IN THE RURAL AREAS ARE BEARABLE. 
I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT THE CONSTRUCTION WORKS OF THE MILLING PLANTS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN TWO PHASES AND WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY CHINA MACHINERY INDUSTRY CONSTRUCTION GROUP INCORPORATED. 
UNDER PHASE ONE OF THIS PROJECT, THREE MILLING PLANTS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED INCLUDING THE ONE TO BE PUT UP RIGHT HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ZAMBIA AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION CENTRE. 
THE OTHER TWO HAVE BEEN EARMARKED FOR MONZE DISTRICT IN SOUTHERN PROVINCE AND MPIKA DISTRICT IN MUCHINGA PROVINCE. 
MY GOVERNMENT, YOUR GOVERNMENT, THE PATRIOTIC FRONT GOVERNMENT, BEING A PRO-POOR GOVERNMENT, HAS PRIORITISED THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE MILLING PLANTS IN RURAL AREAS TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FACED BY OUR PEOPLE IN ACCESSING MAIZE PRODUCTS 
CURRENTLY, MOST MAIZE MILLING COMPANIES ARE LOCATED ALONG THE LINE OF RAIL. STATISTICS INDICATE THAT OUT OF ABOUT FIFTY MILLING PLANTS DOTTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY, OVER THIRTY-NINE ARE IN CITIES AND TOWNS.

DISTINGUISHED GUESTS; LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
WE CAN NOT CONTINUE TO DENY OUR PEOPLE SUCH FACILITIES ON ACCOUNT OF THE AREAS WHERE THEY LIVE. 
THEREFORE, GOVERNMENT HAS PUT IN PLACE THIS INITIATIVE TO TAKE THE PRODUCTION OF MEALIE MEAL AND STOCK FEED TO THE DOOR STEP OF THE SUBSISTENCE FARMER, WHO IS THE MAJOR PRODUCER OF MAIZE IN THE COUNTRY. 
DESPITE THE SUBSISTENCE FARMER’S HARD WORK TO PRODUCE THE MAIZE, IT IS SAD TO NOTE THAT HE OR SHE ACCESSES MEALIE MEAL AND STOCK FEED AT A VERY HIGH PRICE. THIS IS AFTER THE MAIZE PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN PROCESSED IN MILLING PLANTS SITUATED IN URBAN AREAS. THIS TREND HAS TO BE REVERSED! 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT ONCE COMPLETED THE MILLING PLANTS WILL ACCRUE IMMENSE BENEFITS TO OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES. 
OTHER THAN REDUCING THE COST OF PRODUCTION FOR OUR STAPLE FOOD, THE POSITIONING OF THE MILLING PLANTS IN SOME OF THE RURAL AREAS WILL CREATE JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE LOCAL PEOPLE WHO WILL BE EMPLOYED TO WORK IN THE PLANTS.

IT IS MY SINCERE HOPE THAT OVER TIME, THE SKILLS OBTAINED BY THE LOCAL PEOPLE THROUGH TRANSFER OF BOTH TECHNOLOGICAL AND OPERATIONAL KNOW-HOW FROM OUR PARTNERS, WILL NOT ONLY ENHANCE MEALIE MEAL PRODUCTION, BUT ALSO FOSTER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN AREAS WHERE THE PLANTS WILL BE BUILT. 
IN ADDITION, THE MILLING PLANTS WILL OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE READY MARKET FOR THE MAIZE WHICH IS PRODUCED IN THE RESPECTIVE AREAS. THIS WILL RESOLVE THE CHALLENGE OF OUR PEOPLE LOOKING FAR AND WIDE FOR A MARKET FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. 
TRANSPORT COSTS WILL ULTIMATELY REDUCE MAKING MEALIE MEAL AND OTHER MAIZE PRODUCTS AFFORDABLE TO THE COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE VICINITY OF MILLING PLANTS. 
THE MILLING PLANT TO BE CONSTRUCTED AT THIS SITE WILL ALSO BE A TRAINING FACILITY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE WHO WILL BE WORKING IN MILLING PLANTS IN THE COUNTRY. THIS WILL RESULT IN INCREASED EFFICIENCY OF PERSONNEL WORKING IN THE MILLING INDUSTRY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
THOSE WHO WILL BE TRAINED HERE WILL SHARE THE ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES IN OTHER MILLING FACILITIES IN THE COUNTRY.

DISTINGUISHED GUESTS; LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
I AM HAPPY TO NOTE THAT THE THREE PLANTS TO BE CONSTRUCTED IN THE FIRST PHASE WILL HAVE A COMBINED MAXIMUM PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF 520 TONNES PER DAY TRANSLATING INTO 10,400 BY 25 KILOGRAMME BAGS OF MEALIE MEAL PER DAY. THE PLANTS WILL ALSO TAKE APPROXIMATELY 21 MONTHS TO BECOME OPERATIONAL. 
OUT OF THE 13 MILLING PLANTS WHICH WILL BE CONSTRUCTED UNDER THE PRESIDENTIAL MILLING PLANT INITIATIVE, SIX (06) WILL BE MANAGED BY THE ZAMBIA NATIONAL SERVICE. 
IT IS HOPED THAT THEIR DISCIPLINE, PROFESSIONALISM AND CAPABILITY TO OPERATE IN ANY TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT, WILL SURELY TRIGGER ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ASSIST GOVERNMENT TO ATTAIN STABILITY IN THE PRICING OF THE NATION’S STAPLE FOOD. 
THE 13 MILLING PLANTS WHOSE CONSTRUCTION I AM LAUNCHING TODAY WILL BE LOCATED IN KAOMA-WESTERN PROVINCE, MONZE AND MAZABUKA-SOUTHERN PROVINCE, CHIPATA-EASTERN PROVINCE, MPIKA-MUCHINGA PROVINCE, AND SOLWEZI-NORTH WESTERN PROVINCE. 
OTHER PLANTS WILL BE SITUATED IN MUMBWA AND KAPIRI MPOSHI-CENTRAL PROVINCE, LUANSHYA AND KALULUSHI-COPPERBELT PROVINCE, MANSA-LUAPULA PROVINCE, CHONGWE-LUSAKA PROVINCE AND KASAMA IN NORTHERN PROVINCE.

TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WHO WILL PARTNER WITH US ON THIS PROJECT, ON BEHALF OF THE ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE OF ZAMBIA AND INDEED ON MY OWN BEHALF, I WISH TO SINCERELY THANK YOU FOR THIS PARTNERSHIP. 
IT IS ALWAYS COMFORTING TO BE ASSURED THAT IN YOU WE HAVE AN ALL WEATHER-FRIEND. LET US CONTINUE WITH THIS LONG TIME FRIENDSHIP FOR THE GOOD OF OUR PEOPLES. 
MY GOVERNMENT IS RESOLVED TO ADDRESSING DISCREPANCIES IN THE MEALIE MEAL PRICE WHICH ARE EVIDENT ESPECIALLY IN OUR COUNTRY’S RURAL AREAS. 
WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO RENDERING NECESSARY SUPPORT TO YOU THE PROJECT IMPLEMENTERS TO ENSURE THAT THIS LIFE CHANGING PROJECT IS DELIVERED WITHIN THE STIPULATED TIME FRAME. 
THERE IS NO REASON AT ALL FOR THE MEALIE MEAL PRICE TO REMAIN HIGH WHEN MAIZE IS LOCALLY PRODUCED. 
THEREFORE, WITH THIS PROJECT, WE EXPECT MORE BENEFITS TO ACCRUE TO OUR PEOPLE. IT IS IN OUR INTEREST TO ENSURE THAT WE ELIMINATE HUNGER ESPECIALLY AMONG OUR HARD WORKING BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN RURAL AREAS.

THE PATRIOTIC FRONT GOVERNMENT WILL NOT SHIFT FROM ITS PRO-POOR POLICIES AS THIS IS THE MANDATE UPON WHICH WE WERE PUT INTO POWER BY THE ZAMBIAN PEOPLE. 
OUR COMMITMENT TO CHANGING THE FACE OF THIS COUNTRY IS ALSO EVIDENT IN THE INNUMERABLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WHICH WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND ARE STILL DOING SO. 
WITH THESE REMARKS, IT IS NOW MY SINGULAR HONOUR AND PRIVILEGE TO DECLARE THE CONSTRUCTION OF MILLING PLANTS UNDER THE PRESIDENTIAL MILLING PLANTS INITIATIVE OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED. 
MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND OUR COUNTRY, 
I THANK YOU.
