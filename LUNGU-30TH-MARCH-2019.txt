DISTINGUISHED GUESTS; LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
WE DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF TIME, HENCE OUR UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO DEVELOP A SKILLED HUMAN RESOURCE WHICH WILL DRIVE THE COUNTRY’S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THIS VISION CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED, IF QUALITY EDUCATION AT ALL LEVELS IS MADE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL ZAMBIANS. 
THE PF GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ONLY ENVISAGE PROVIDING ACCESS TO EDUCATION, BUT EQUALLY, QUALITY AND RELEVANT EDUCATION WHICH RESPONDS TO THE ISSUES AFFECTING OUR COUNTRY TODAY. 
WE ARE ALREADY RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR THROUGH THE SEVENTH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN, WHICH CLEARLY PLACES PREMIUM ON EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT. 
ONCE THE FUNDAMENTALS OF EDUCATION ARE PUT RIGHT, IT IS A SURE WAY FOR US TO ATTAIN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL (SDG) NUMBER 4 ON EDUCATION. 
THIS GOAL IS AIMED AT ENSURING INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE QUALITY EDUCATION, AND TO PROMOTE LIFE- LONG LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
ENSURING INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE QUALITY EDUCATION SEEMS TO BE AN ONEROUS TASK, BUT IT IS NOT INSURMOUNTABLE. MY GOVERNMENT WILL ENDEAVOUR TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ATTAIN THIS TASK THROUGH VARIOUS MILESTONES WE HAVE SET FOR OURSELVES. 
ONE SUCH MILESTONE IS THE TRANSFORMATION OF KWAME NKRUMAH FROM A COLLEGE INTO A UNIVERSITY WHICH WE ARE WITNESSING TODAY. 
OUR ACHIEVEMENTS AS PF GOVERNMENT ARE CONSPICUOUS FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE. IN THIS VEIN, I WISH TO STATE THAT THESE ARE NOT MERE STORIES. WE WANT TO TRANSFORM THE LIVES OF OUR PEOPLE AND THERE IS NO BETTER WAY THAN BRINGING EDUCATION CLOSER TO THEM. 
AS WE ALL KNOW, EDUCATION OPENS UP OPPORTUNITIES IN LIFE AND IT IS A KEY REQUISITE TO NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PROSPERITY INCLUDING THE WELLBEING OF OUR NATION. 
MY GOVERNMENT WILL REMAIN COMMITTED TO FULFILLING OUR PROMISE TO THE PEOPLE OF ZAMBIA, TO DELIVER QUALITY SERVICES TO ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. 
IN THIS REGARD, WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THIS AMBITIOUS INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMME THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. INDEED, WE ARE WALKING THE TALK.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
SINCE 2011 TODATE, THE PF GOVERNMENT HAS TRANSFORMED ZAMBIA. TODAY, OUR COUNTRY HAS A DIFFERENT OUTLOOK INFRASTRUCTURE WISE. 
UNDER HIGHER EDUCATION, WE PROMISED TO CONSTRUCT AT LEAST ONE UNIVERSITY IN EACH OF THE TEN PROVINCES. I AM GLAD TO NOTE THAT SO FAR, WE HAVE SEVEN (7) OPERATIONAL UNIVERSITIES; ONE (1) IN MUCHINGA, TWO (2) IN COPPERBELT, TWO (2) IN LUSAKA AND TWO (2) IN CENTRAL PROVINCES. 
IN ADDITION, CONSTRUCTION WORKS HAVE COMMENCED AT UNIVERSITIES IN MUCHINGA, LUAPULA, NORTHERN AND WESTERN PROVINCES. THIS IS A MARK OF A WORKING GOVERNMENT FULFULLING ITS CAMPAIGN PROMISES TO OUR PEOPLE. 
BUT I KNOW OTHERS HAVE DELIBERATELY CHOSEN TO TURN A BLIND EYE TO WHAT WE ARE DOING. HOWEVER, WE WILL NOT BE DETERRED BY THAT, BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AND DELIVERING ON OUR MANDATE.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
THE CHINESE PEOPLE HAVE SAID AND I QUOTE; 
“A JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES STARTS WITH 
ONE STEP.” ENDS THE QUOTE 
OUR JOURNEY MAY SEEM VERY LONG, BUT EACH STEP WE HAVE TAKEN AS THE GOVERNMENT IN POWER HAS MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE. 
PHASE ONE OF THIS PROJECT CONSISTED OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO HOSTEL BLOCKS, TWO DOUBLE STOREY LECTURE ROOM BLOCKS, ONE LECTURE THEATRE AND A DOUBLE STOREY LIBRARY BLOCK. 
THE SECOND PHASE CONSTITUTED WORKS ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO HOSTEL BLOCKS, TWO LECTURE ROOM BLOCKS, TEN LECTURERS’ HOUSES AND ONE LECTURE THEATRE. 
THIS, DEAR COUNTRYMEN AND WOMEN, IS A KEY INTERVENTION IN OUR QUEST TO COMPLETING THE JOURNEY OF PROVIDING QUALITY HIGHER EDUCATION. 
THIS EXPANSION ALSO REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARDS ACHIEVING GOVERNMENT’S ASPIRATIONS OF HAVING A DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY THROUGH A UNIVERSITY FOCUSED ON TRAINING TEACHERS. THESE TEACHERS WILL IN TURN PROPEL TALENT DEVELOPMENT IN VARIOUS SECTORS.

I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY IN PROVIDING NOT ONLY THE MUCH-NEEDED HUMAN RESOURCE IN THE REQUIRED SPECIALISED AREAS, BUT ALSO HELP IN REDUCING THE DEFICIT CURRENTLY BEING FACED IN THE COUNTRY. 
I WANT TO COMMEND ALL GOVERNMENT OFFICERS FROM THE MINISTRIES OF GENERAL AND HIGHER EDUCATION, WHO HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT. 
THIS COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IS A DEMONSTRATION OF POSITIVE OUTCOMES OF A CLUSTER APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT PLANNING AS FRAMED IN OUR SEVENTH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN. 
LET ME ALSO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK THE CONTRACTOR HUA JIANG INVESTMENTS ZAMBIA LIMITED FOR THE EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY WORK UNDERTAKEN ON THIS PROJECT. 
ALL PROJECTS WE UNDERTAKE SHOULD ALWAYS DEMONSTRATE VALUE FOR MONEY. WITH THIS PROJECT, I AM CERTAIN THE NATION WILL GAIN THE VALUE FOR MONEY PAID IN FORM OF TAXES.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
AT THIS MOMENT, LET ME DIRECT THE MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO MAKE KWAME NKRUMAH A FLAGSHIP UNIVERSITY IN THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. WE ALL KNOW THAT TEACHERS SHAPE THE COUNTRY. THEY ARE THE KINGPINS OF HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT. 
THEREFORE, THE CHOICE OF BEING TRAINED AS A TEACHER SHOULD NOT BE “A BY THE WAY”. THE TEACHERS TO BE TRAINED HERE AT KWAME NKRUMAH UNIVERSITY SHOULD BE AS GOOD AS THOSE BEING SELECTED TO PURSUE OTHER COURSES SUCH AS ENGINEERING, MEDICINE AND SO FORTH. 
I WISH TO REITERATE MY GOVERNMENT’S COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING AND ADVANCING HIGHER EDUCATION THROUGH AMONG OTHER THINGS AVAILABILITY OF ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN OUR TRAINING INSTITUTES. 
LET ME CONCLUDE BY URGING EVERYONE IN CENTRAL PROVINCE IN PARTICULAR, AND THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE, TO GUARD THIS INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT AT A HUGE COST, AND TREAT IT AS IF IT WERE YOUR PERSONAL PROPERTY. 
IT IS NOW MY SINGULAR HONOUR AND PRIVILEGE TO DECLARE KWAME NKRUMAH UNIVERSITY OFFICIALLY COMMISSIONED. GOD BLESS YOU ALL, GOD BLESS ZAMBIA, I THANK YOU.
