IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO BE PART OF THIS WALK AGAIN, AFTER BEING WITH YOU LAST YEAR DURING ANOTHER FUNDRAISER AIMED AT MOBILISING FUNDS FOR RUNNING THIS HOME. 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT IS NOT EASY FOR ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS TO EXTEND A GIVING HAND. HOWEVER, I WISH TO ENCOURAGE ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON THE NEED TO DONATE TOWARDS THE RUNNING OF THIS HOME. 
IT IS OUR GOD-GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AFTER THE VULNERABLE AMONG THEM THE SENIOR CITIZENS, CHILDREN AND WOMEN. 
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO HOPE OF A MEAL, ACCOMMODATION AND ANY CARE. HOW CAN WE THEN BE COMFORTABLE IN OUR COMFORT ZONES IN THE MIDST OF ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO NEED OUR HELP? CERTAINLY, WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

MR CHAIRPERSON: 
I AM INFORMED THAT THIS YEAR MARKS 27 YEARS SINCE THIS HOME WAS OPENED. THIS IS A BIG ACHIEVEMENT AND CONGRATULATIONS! 
WITHOUT THIS HOME A NUMBER OF THOSE IN NEED WOULD NOT HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE CARED FOR. WE NEED MORE OF SUCH GENUINE HOMES TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THOSE WHO ARE LESS PRIVILEDGED. 
AS A NATION WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT NATIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES AND I RECKON THAT THIS DOES NOT MERELY APPEAL TO OUR GOOD CHARACTER AS CITIZENS, BUT EQUALLY, TO THE WAY WE TREAT THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED IN SOCIETY. 
GOOD VALUES ALSO ENTAIL THAT WE TAKE UP THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TAKING CARE OF OUR AGED RELATIVES AND THOSE WHO ARE VULNERABLE. IT IS MORALLY WRONG FOR US TO ABANDON THE AGED IN SOCIETY. 
IT IS SAD TO NOTE THAT TODAY WE NO LONGER EMBRACE THE VALUE OF THE EXTENDED FAMILY. THE EXTENDED FAMILY SYSTEM IS BROKEN DOWN.

MOST OF US HERE ARE WHERE WE ARE TODAY BECAUSE OF THE EXTENDED FAMILY. SOME OF US MAY NOT HAVE ACQUIRED EDUCATION TO PROPEL US TO WHERE WE ARE NOW, HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE EXTENDED FAMILY. 
MOREOVER, IN THE AFRICAN CULTURE, EVERYONE HAS A RELATIVE. HOWEVER, THE CHALLENGE TODAY IS THAT FAMILIES AND INDEED COMMUNITIES ARE SHUNNING AWAY FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LOOKING AFTER THOSE WHO ARE DESTITUTE, HENCE WE SEE SUCH STRUCTURES AS CHESHIRE HOMES. 
THE MEANING OF FAMILY HAS NOW BEEN RESTRICTED TO NUCLEAR SET UP. THIS HAS RESULTED IN OUR SENIOR CITIZENS OR ORPHANS HAVING NO ONE TO LOOK AFTER THEM. 
TODAY, WE CAN EVEN TALK ABOUT ORPHANS BECAUSE SOCIETY HAS ABANDONED THE VALUE OF LOOKING AFTER THESE VULNERABLE CHILDREN. 
WE MUST REVISIT OUR FAMILY VALUES AND ONCE AGAIN BUILD A CULTURE OF LOVING AND CARING FOR ONE ANOTHER. OUR SOCIETY WOULD HAVE NO DESTITUTE SENIOR CITIZENS, IF OUR FAMILIES WERE LOVING AND CARING.

WE HAVE DRIFTED AWAY FROM OUR CULTURE OF EMBRACING FAMILY VALUES WHICH INCLUDE ENSURING THAT EVERYONE LIVES WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE FAMILY SET UP. WE SHOULD NOT BE PROUD TO LEAVE OUR PARENTS IN CARE HOMES WHEN WE ARE STILL ALIVE. IT IS INDEED SAD! 
THE BEMBA PEOPLE HAVE SAID AND I QUOTE: 
MAYO MPAPA NAINE NKAKUPAPA! END OF QUOTE. 
THIS IS SIMPLY A CALL TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND INDEED EVERYONE THAT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO LOOK AFTER OUR AGED PARENTS, THE SAME WAY THEY NURTURED US TO BE WHO WE ARE IN SOCIETY. 
THEREFORE, SUCH HOMES LIKE CHESHIRE SHOULD ONLY BE FOR THOSE WHO ARE REALLY VULNERABLE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO RELATIVES AND NO MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD. 
I THEREFORE CALL UPON EACH ONE OF YOU FELLOW ZAMBIANS TO SERIOUSLY TAKE UP THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN RELATIVES AND THOSE OUTSIDE OUR OWN FAMILIES, BUT ARE VULNERABLE.

I WISH TO APPEAL TO ALL OF YOU GATHERED HERE TO RENDER YOUR SUPPORT TO THIS HOME TO ENABLE IT RUN EFFECTIVELY. GOD DELIGHTS IN OUR GIVING. 2 CORINTHIANS 9 VERSE 7 SAYS: 
“SO LET EACH ONE GIVE AS HE PURPOSES IN HIS HEART, NOT GRUDGINGLY OR OF NECESSITY; FOR GOD LOVES A CHEERFUL GIVER.” 
THIS HOME HAS VARIOUS EXPENSES WHICH INCLUDE TRANSPORTATION OF PATIENTS TO HOSPITAL HENCE THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE TRANSPORT, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE INCLUDING ELECTRICITY BILLS. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE TOTAL EXPENDITURE OF A MINIMUM OF K1, 500.00 PER DAY. 
I WISH TO COMMEND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING THIS HOME WITH YOUR UNWAVERING COMMITMENT, PLEASE CONTINUE BECAUSE THIS HOME RELIES ON YOU. 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
LET ME APPEAL TO ALL OF YOU BEFORE LEAVING THIS PLACE TO ENSURE THAT YOU DONATE GENEROUSLY, AND MAKE PLEDGES TO THE HOME, WHICH SHOULD BE FULFILLED WITHOUT FAIL. 
AS I END, LET ME THANK THE CHESHIRE MANAGEMENT BOARD FOR YOUR EFFORTS TOWARDS IMPROVING THE LIVES OF OUR SENIOR CITIZENS. GOD BLESS YOU ALL, I THANKYOU.
