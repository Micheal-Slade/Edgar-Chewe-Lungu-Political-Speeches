I AM DELIGHTED TO BE PART OF THIS OCCASION TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW CHRISTIANS AND THE CHURCH HAVE BEEN PROMOTING JUSTICE AND PEACE APART FROM FOSTERING FELLOWSHIP AND BENEVOLENCE FOR A BETTER SOCIETY. 
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK OF THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES IS DIVIDED INTO THREE: NAMELY CHURCH RELATIONS, ECUMENICAL STUDY AND PROMOTION, AS WELL AS, INTER- CHURCH AID AND SERVICE TO REFUGEES. 
IT IS GRATIFYING TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE GROUPS AND COMMISSIONS WHICH FACILITATE THE CHURCH PROGRAMMES WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE LAITY IN THE CHURCH AND ON THE COOPERATION OF MEN AND WOMEN IN CHURCH AND SOCIETY. 
I AM ALSO DELIGHTED TO LEARN THAT THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES CARRIES OUT HUMANITARIAN WORK BY ASSISTING SCHOOLS AND ORPHANAGES WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION FOR GIRLS. THE WORKS ARE CONDUCTED IN REFUGEE CAMPS IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO ATTEND CLINICS AND HEALTH EDUCATION GROUPS. 
3 
BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST: 
LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COMMEND THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES FOR THE HUMANITARIAN WORKS WHICH HAVE BEEN RENDERED TO SOCIETY OVER THE PAST 70 YEARS THE COUNCIL HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE. 
THE SELFLESS WORKS OF MERCY TO SOCIETY BY THE CHURCH CANNOT GO UNNOTICED AS THIS HAS HELPED TO MITIGATE THE SUFFERING POOR PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES GO THROUGH. 
AS GOVERNMENT, WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIRELESS EFFORTS COMPLEMENTED BY INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES AIMED AT IMPROVING THE SOCIAL STATUS OF OUR PEOPLE. 
MY GOVERNMENT IS KEEN NOT ONLY TO DRAW MORE LESSONS FROM THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES BY TAPPING INTO THEIR WISDOM ON SERVICE DELIVERY TO THE NEEDY IN SOCIETY, BUT TO ALSO COOPERATE IN VARIOUS FIELDS FOR THE GOOD OF MAJORITY ZAMBIANS. 
4 
BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN CHRIST: 
I AM AWARE THAT OUR OWN COUNCIL OF CHURCHES IN ZAMBIA, WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR 103 YEARS, HAS BEEN COLLABORATING WITH THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES. 
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE WORKS OF THE COUNCIL OF CHURCHES IN ZAMBIA ARE A REFLECTION OF THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. 
THE PF GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THE ROLE THAT THE COUNCIL OF CHURCHES IN ZAMBIA HAS BEEN PLAYING IN SHAPING SOCIETIES THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS PROGRAMMES TO OUR COMMUNITIES. 
LET ME EXPRESS MY GOVERNMENT’S GRATITUDE FOR YOUR UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO THE PROVISION OF QUALITY HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO OUR PEOPLE IN THE RURAL PARTS OF ZAMBIA. 
I AM ALSO AWARE THAT THE COUNCIL OF CHURCHES IN ZAMBIA HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUILDING CAPACITY IN DISASTER RISK REDUCTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE MANAGEMENT. 
5 
YOUR CONTINUED PROVISION OF SUPPORT TO OUR PEOPLE IN VARIOUS AREAS IS IN FULFILMENT OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST, WHICH COMPELS US TO DO SO. PROVERBS CHAPTER 19 VERSE 17 SAYS AND I QUOTE: 
“THE ONE WHO IS GRACIOUS TO THE POOR 
LENDS TO THE LORD, AND THE LORD WILL REPAY 
HIM FOR HIS GOOD DEED,” END OF QUOTE. 
6 
BROTHERS AND SISTERS: 
IT IS UNNECESSARY FOR THE CHURCH AND GOVERNMENT TO BE HOSTILE TO EACH OTHER. WE ALL HAVE A COMMON PURPOSE TO SERVE THE POOR PEOPLE. 
WE HAVE AN ONEROUS TASK TO UPLIFT THE SOCIAL STATUS OF OUR PEOPLE HENCE OURS IS TO COMPLETE EACH OTHER. 
IN THIS REGARD, AS GOVERNMENT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CHURCH TO FOSTER UNITY AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ZAMBIA. THE CHURCH SHOULD BE IN THE FOREFRONT SOWING SEEDS OF LOVE AND NOT DISCORD. 
FOR A LONG TIME NOW, ZAMBIA HAS SEEN THE CHURCH BEING AT THE HELM OF PROMOTING PEACE AND UNITY ACROSS POLITICAL DIVIDES. IT IS THEREFORE, OUR HOPE THAT THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE TO SOW SEEDS OF LOVE, PEACE AND UNITY 
SIMILARLY, OUR GOVERNMENT HAS CONTINUED IN ITS QUEST TO PROMOTE NATIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES PREMISED ON PATRIOTISM AND NATIONAL UNITY AMONG OTHERS. 
7 
IN THIS RESPECT, LET US CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER TO PROMOTE OUR MOTTO OF ONE ZAMBIA, ONE NATION WHICH TRANSCENDS ALL AFFILIATIONS. 
FOR THE CHURCH AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN BUILDING NATIONAL UNITY, THERE IS NEED TO BE ABOVE POLITICS. 
THE CHURCH SHOULD BE NON-PARTISAN, AS IT HAS BEEN MANDATED BY GOD TO BRING PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE TO WORK TOGETHER REGARDLESS OF THEIR PERSUASIONS. 
WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT AS THE LIGHT AND SALT OF THE EARTH, THE CHURCH WILL BE ABOVE BOARD AND CONTINUE TO PROMOTE PEACE, JUSTICE AND UNITY AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ZAMBIA. 
8 
BROTHERS AND SISTERS: 
AS I CONCLUDE I WISH TO CALL UPON OTHER FAITH BASED ORGANISATIONS IN THE COUNTRY TO EMULATE THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES AND COUNCIL OF CHURCHES IN ZAMBIA BY REACHING OUT TO THE NEEDY IN OUR SOCIETY. 
THIS IS IN ADDITION TO MAINTAINING THEIR MAIN CALL OF SPREADING THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST. 
LET ME NOW CONGRATULATE THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES FOR ITS 70TH ANNIVERSARY. 
TO OUR VISITORS FROM ABROAD, WE WELCOME YOU. ZAMBIA IS A HAVEN OF PEACE AND HAS MANY ATTRACTIVE TOURISM SITES WHICH YOU NEED TO SAMPLE DURING YOUR STAY IN ZAMBIA. 
EXAMPLES OF SUCH SITES INCLUDE CHITAMBO VILLAGE IN CENTRAL PROVINCE WHERE THE SCOTTISH MISSIONARY DR. DAVID LIVINGSTONE SAID A PROPHETIC PRAYER FOR ZAMBIA BEFORE BREATHING HIS LAST. 
9 
AS A CHRISTIAN NATION, WE DRAW A LOT OF INSPIRATION FROM THIS POWERFUL PRAYER AND I QUOTE IT FOLLOWS: 
“LORD, FROM THE LAND UPON WHICH MY KNEES REST, RAISE A MIGHTY CHRISTIAN NATION, A NATION THAT WILL BECOME A BEACON OF LIGHT AND HOPE TO THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA, A NATION THAT WILL TAKE THE GOSPEL TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH,” END OF PRAYER. 
IT IS NOW MY PRIVILEDGE AND HONOUR TO OFFICIALLY DECLARE THE WORSHIP SERVICE TO MARK CELEBRATIONS FOR THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES AND THE 31ST GENERAL CONFERENCE OF THE COUNCIL OF CHURCHES IN ZAMBIA OPEN. 
I WISH YOU FRUITFUL DELIBERATIONS. 
GOD BLESS YOU ALL. 
I THANK YOU.
