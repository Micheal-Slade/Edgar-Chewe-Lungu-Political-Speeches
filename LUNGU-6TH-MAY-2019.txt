AS I ADDRESS THIS CONFERENCE, I WISH TO CONGRATULATE YOUR ASSOCIATION WHICH, SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 1947, HAS NOT ONLY CONCENTRATED ON PROTECTING YOUR MEMBERS’ INTERESTS, BUT HAS ALSO MADE COLLECTIVE EFFORTS TO SHAPE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM INTO A STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT PARTNER FOR CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. I COMMEND THE ASSOCIATION FOR THIS EFFORT. 
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM IS VERY CRITICAL TO OUR DEVELOPMENT ASPIRATIONS, AS IT PROVIDES THE FRONTLINE SERVICES TO OUR PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
TO THIS EFFECT, GOVERNMENT WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN TO PROGRESSIVE AND POSITIVE IDEAS WHICH ARE AIMED AT ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES. 
MR. PRESIDENT; LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
THE THEME FOR THIS YEAR’S CONFERENCE, “EMBRACING E-GOVERNMENT FOR IMPROVED LOCAL SERVICE DELIVERY”, IS VERY RELEVANT AS IT RESONATES WELL WITH THE ASPIRATIONS OF GOVERNMENT AND THE CITIZENS OF BUILDING A SMART ZAMBIA. 
IN KEEPING WITH THIS AMBITION, GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE SEVENTH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN IS DETERMINED TO ENSURE THE UTILISATION OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY.

IT IS OUR DESIRE TO ENSURE THAT OUR CITIZENS ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY PROFICIENT AND FULLY ABLE TO ADAPT AND INNOVATE IN THE UTILISATION OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS). THEREFORE, LOCAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE LEFT OUT IN THIS ENDEAVOUR. 
THE ROLE OF ICTS IN PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY CANNOT BE OVER EMPHASISED. WITH ICTS PUBLIC SERVICES ARE DELIVERED TO OUR CITIZENS IN REAL TIME. 
PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ARE ALSO ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND INDEED, BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO INTERACT AND ACCESS PUBLIC SERVICES EFFICIENTLY. 
THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF E-GOVERNMENT, THEREFORE, REQUIRES THAT WE REMAIN RESOLUTE IN PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN ICTs. 
IF WELL UTILISED AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL, ICTS CAN OFFER TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO RAISE THE STANDARDS OF LIVING, AND INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP AT LOCAL LEVEL. 
IT IS GRATIFYING TO NOTE THAT THIS JOINT CONFERENCE WILL DEDICATE SOME TIME ON THIS SUBJECT IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE IMPROVED AND EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF SERVICES BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

IN THIS REGARD, I CHALLENGE ALL THE DELEGATES TO THIS CONFERENCE TO EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE DURING THE DELIBERATIONS SO THAT YOU EQUIP YOURSELVES WITH THE ICTS FOR USE IN YOUR DAY TO DAY WORK. 
FURTHER, TO EFFECTIVELY FACILITATE FOR ICTS TO BE EMBRACED AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THERE IS NEED FOR TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP AT ALL LEVELS. 
THIS LEADERSHIP SHOULD BUY INTO THE VISION OF GOVERNMENT OF ATTAINING A SMART ZAMBIA TOWARDS ACHIEVING PROSPERITY FOR OUR CITIZENS. 
A LEADERSHIP, WHICH IS INSPIRATIONAL AND OPTIMISTIC IN DEALING WITH ALL ASPECTS OF LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT, IS KEY TO ACHIEVING DESIROUS RESULTS. 
YOUR SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE WHO PUT YOU INTO LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP IS NOBLE. I THEREFORE, CHALLENGE YOU TO PUT SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE FIRST, IF WE ARE TO DELIVER ON OUR PROMISES AS THE PF GOVERNMENT. 
I URGE YOU NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF YOUR PRIMARY LEADERSHIP ROLE OF ENSURING THAT YOUR RESPECTIVE LOCAL AUTHORITIES DELIVER VITAL PUBLIC SERVICES TO BOOST OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AT LOCAL LEVEL. 
YOU HAVE AN ONEROUS TASK TO MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF OUR CITIZENS. YOU ARE CALLED TO SERVE HONESTLY AND DILIGENTLY.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
IN ALL THAT WE DO COLLECTIVELY AS LEADERS, WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT IT IS SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF ZAMBIA WHICH MATTER THE MOST ABOVE ALL ELSE. 
STEPHEN R. COVEY, A RENOWNED AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP CONSULTANT AND MENTOR ONCE SAID AND I QUOTE, 
“ORGANISATIONS ARE ESTABLISHED TO SERVE HUMAN NEEDS AND SERVICE IS THE RENT WE PAY FOR LIVING IN THE WORLD OF OURS,” END OF QUOTE. 
THIS POINTS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF US PUTTING SERVICE ABOVE SELF. 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROMOTES GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY, AS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AT LOCAL LEVEL ARE ANSWERABLE TO THE PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS TO CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN MEETING THE PUBLIC SERVICE NEEDS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 156 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF ZAMBIA. 
PEOPLE OF ZAMBIA SAW IT NECESSARY TO ENTRENCH THE SYSTEMS OF DEVOLUTION AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THE REPUBLICAN CONSTITUTION, AS A MEASURE TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO DELIVER SERVICES IN AREAS UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION, AND TO HOLD COUNCILLORS ACCOUNTABLE.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
MY GOVERNMENT REMAINS COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENTING THE NATIONAL DECENTRALISATION POLICY. 
WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT SERVICES ARE BROUGHT CLOSER TO THE CITIZENS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I, THEREFORE, WISH TO CALL UPON ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IMPORTANT POLICY. 
A DECENTRALISED SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE GIVES LOCAL PEOPLE THE LIBERTY TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN DECISION-MAKING WITH REGARD TO RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND SERVICE DELIVERY AS BENEFICIARIES OF A FULLY DEVOLVED LOCAL GOVERNMENT. 
AS FAR AS MY GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED, THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE TO DECENTRALISATION. THIS IS A RECIPE FOR GOOD AND RESPONSIVE GOVERNANCE. 
FURTHER, DECENTRALISATION PROVIDES ACCOUNTABILITY AND PRUDENT USE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNANCE. 
GOING FORWARD, AS GOVERNMENT, WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR FUNCTIONS IN LINE WITH THE LAW.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
THE ENACTMENT OF THE RATING ACT NUMBER 21 OF 2018 AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT 2019, IS TESTIMONY OF MY GOVERNMENT’S COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE IMPLEMENTED. 
IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENT HAS PUT IN PLACE THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL FISCAL ARCHITECTURE IN AN EFFORT TO STREAMLINE THE FISCAL INTERFACE BETWEEN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. 
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS THE DUTY OF EVERY LOCAL AUTHORITY TO LET THEIR COMMUNITIES KNOW THE RESOURCES AT THEIR DISPOSAL AND HOW THESE RESOURCES ARE UTILISED. 
SIMILARLY, COMMUNITIES MUST BE KEPT INFORMED OF THE CHALLENGES THE LOCAL AUTHORITY IS FACED WITH IN THE EXECUTION OF ITS FUNCTIONS. 
THIS INTERACTION WILL RESULT IN ENHANCED ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY. 
IT IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO TAP INTO EXPERTISE AVAILABLE AT LOCAL LEVEL IN ACHIEVING DESIRED DEVELOPMENTAL GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS.

MR. PRESIDENT; LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
LET ME NOW TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY, TO SPEAK ON A SUBJECT CLOSE TO MY HEART, AND THIS IS CLEANLINESS OF THE ENVIRONMENT. 
IT IS A MORAL VIRTUE FOR EACH ONE OF US TO ENSURE THAT WE MAINTAIN A CLEAN AND GREEN ENVIRONMENT. 
THE CONSTITUTION UNDER ARTICLE 151 (2) (F) PLACES AN OBLIGATION ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO PROMOTE A CLEAN, GREEN AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT. 
DESPITE THE LAW BEING IN PLACE, IT IS DISAPPOINTING TO NOTE THAT THE ENVIRONMENT HAS CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE AS A FAST RATE THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSS OF LIFE ON A DAILY BASIS DUE TO COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND OTHER CALAMITIES. 
KEEPING OUR ENVIRONMENT CLEAN AND GREEN IS ESSENTIAL FOR HUMAN SURVIVAL AND WELL-BEING, AS WELL AS ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. 
MY APPEAL TO YOU AS CIVIC LEADERS GATHERED HERE IS FOR YOU TO DOUBLE UP EFFORTS IN ENSURING THAT OUR DISTRICTS ARE KEPT CLEAN, SAFE AND HEALTHY.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
THIS IS POSSIBLE AS EXAMPLES ARE THERE TO SHOW PARTICULARLY WHEN OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM SHOWED US THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE CITIES, MUNICIPALITIES, TOWNS AND COMMUNITIES CLEAN AND ERADICATE POTENTIAL DISEASES. 
AS I CONCLUDE, I WISH TO CALL UPON YOU ALL TO REFLECT ON THE STRATEGIES NEEDED TO STRENGTHEN E- GOVERNMENT FOR IMPROVED LOCAL SERVICE DELIVERY, AS WE TRANSFORM OUR SOCIETIES INTO SMART CITIES. 
THIS WILL ACCELERATE THE ATTAINMENT OF HUMAN, SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AT LOCAL LEVEL. 
AS LOCAL AUTHORITIES, YOU ARE EXPECTED TO STRIVE TO BE IN TANDEM WITH THE E-GOVERNMENT POLICY, IF WE, AS A NATION, ARE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE QUALITY SERVICES TO OUR PEOPLE FOR IMPROVED LIVING STANDARDS. 
IT IS NOW MY SINGULAR HONOUR AND PRIVILEGE TO DECLARE THIS JOINT 63RD ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION OF ZAMBIA AND THE 16TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE ALLIANCE OF MAYORS AND MUNICIPAL LEADERS’ INITIATIVES FOR COMMUNITY ACTION ON AIDS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OFFICIALLY OPEN. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL, I THANK YOU.
