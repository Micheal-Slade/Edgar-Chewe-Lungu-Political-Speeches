IT IS INDEED A GREAT PLEASURE TO COMMISSION YET ANOTHER FACILITY IN THE EDUCATION SECTOR. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, I COMMISSIONED NKWAME KHRUMAH AND MUKUBA UNIVERSITIES IN CENTRAL AND COPPERBELT PROVINCES RESPECTIVELY. 
TODAY, WE HAVE YET AGAIN SCORED, AND THIS IS WHY I AM HERE TO COMMISSION THIS NEWLY CONSTRUCTED MWENSE TRADES TRAINING INSTITUTE. THIS PROJECT IS PART OF GOVERNMENT’S EFFORTS TO DELIVER SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY. 
THE LAUNCH OF THIS FACILITY COMES AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF GOVERNMENT’S PLAN TO CREATE A NEW APPROACH AND PLATFORM FOR EDUCATION AND SKILLS TRAINING, AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF THIS DISTRICT. 
THIS INSTITUTION WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL EDUCATION, VOCATIONAL AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP TRAINING IN THE NORTHERN CIRCUIT. 
MWENSE TRAINING INSTITUTE WILL THUS, CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SKILLS WHICH ARE PERTINENT TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THIS CIRCUIT.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
GOVERNMENT HAS RECOGNISED AND POSITIONED SKILLS DEVELOPMENT AS ONE OF THE KEY PILLARS FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO SKILLS TRAINING. 
AS SUCH, WE WILL CONTINUE PROMOTING INVESTMENTS IN SKILLS DEVELOPMENT BY ESTABLISHING MORE VOCATIONAL TRAINING INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
WE ARE EQUALLY, CONSTRUCTING OTHER TRADES TRAINING INSTITUTES IN LUNDAZI, SESHEKE, MPOROKOSO, ISOKA, MUMBWA, AND KALABO DISTRICTS. THIS IS IN FULFILMENT OF OUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT WE TAKE DEVELOPMENT TO ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. 
THE PF GOVERNMENT HAS INTENTIONS TO CREATE INSTITUTIONS WITH ENHANCED EFFICIENCY WHICH OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE SPECTRUM OF QUALIFICATIONS, CONSISTENT WITH THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR GROWING ECONOMY. 
THE COMMISSIONING OF THIS NEW TRAINING FACILITY HERE IN MWENSE IS THEREFORE, ONE IMPORTANT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION.

IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE TRAINING TO BE PROVIDED HERE WILL MEET THE NEEDS OF EMPLOYERS IN BOTH THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS. THIS IS ONLY POSSIBLE, IF ALL KEY STAKEHOLDERS WORK TOGETHER. 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS INSTITUTE WILL MEET THE ASPIRATIONS OF LUAPULA PROVINCE, AS WE CONTINUE TO STRATEGICALLY POSITION THE PROVINCE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. 
HOWEVER, I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT DESPITE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT ZAMBIA HAS RECORDED IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS, THE CURRENT EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE RATE AT WHICH YOUNG PERSONS ARE LEAVING SCHOOL AND SEEKING EMPLOYMENT, BOTH FORMAL AND SELF- EMPLOYMENT. 
THE YOUTH LABOUR MARKET IS SAID TO BE DEPENDENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND LABOUR DEMAND. 
THEREFORE, THIS DEMAND FOR LABOUR WILL REQUIRE TO BE MET BY A CORRESPONDING SUPPLY OF SUITABLE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE. 
IT HAS ALSO BEEN OBSERVED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A RAPID INCREASE IN INVESTMENTS IN THE MINING SECTOR IN ZAMBIA OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. NEVERTHELESS, MANY STRONGLY FEEL THAT THIS HAS NOT MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO ADDRESSING THE UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG THE YOUTHS.

ON THE OTHER HAND, EMPLOYERS, INDICATE THAT THEY CANNOT FIND SUITABLY QUALIFIED YOUTHS FOR CURRENT JOBS IN THE INDUSTRY. THEREFORE, THERE EXISTS THE PARADOX OF INCREASING YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE MIDST OF GROWING ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY. 
IT IS IMPERATIVE THEREFORE, THAT WE ADDRESS THIS INCONSISTENCE IN THE LABOUR MARKET. 
TODAY, WE ARE FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE OF HOW TO ENHANCE ABILITY AND CAPACITY FOR EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS IN RELATION TO TAKING IN MORE YOUTHS AND TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE WORLD OF WORK, EITHER IN FORMAL EMPLOYMENT, OR INDEED AS SELF- EMPLOYED PERSONS, ENGAGED IN ENTREPRENEURIAL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. 
TIME HAS COME FOR US TO ENSURE THAT WE GROOM OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BEGIN TO PONDER SETTING UP THEIR OWN ENTERPRISES, AS OPPOSED TO THE TRADITIONAL THINKING OF ONLY GETTING INTO WHITE COLLAR JOBS. 
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH WHITE COLLAR JOBS BUT, IF WE HAVE TO ENSURE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THIS COUNTRY, OUR YOUNG PEOPLE MUST BEGIN TO THINK BEYOND THE BOX, BY USING THEIR INGENUITY AND ACQUIRED SKILLS.

GOING FORWARD, I WISH TO APPEAL TO YOU OUR YOUNG PEOPLE; ONCE YOU ACQUIRE THE SKILLS FROM THIS INSTITUTE OR ANY OTHER INSTITUTE ACROSS THE COUNTRY DON’T SIT BACK AND START WHINNING ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT. 
HOWEVER, USE YOUR SKILLS TO SET UP YOUR OWN BUSINESS, WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO JOB CREATION. DON’T BE AFRAID TO VENTURE INTO DIFFERENT ENTERPRISES. 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
GOVERNMENT IS AWARE OF THE NEED TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN SKILLS TRAINING, AND MEANINGFUL AND DECENT WORK FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, HENCE OUR PROVISION OF TWENTY MILLION KWACHA (K20,000,000) FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS INSTITUTE. WE FURTHER PROVIDED EQUIPMENT AND OFFICE FURNITURE AT A COST OF FIVE MILLION KWACHA (K5,000,000). 
ONCE FULLY OPERATIONAL, THIS FACILITY WILL EQUIP OUR YOUTHS WITH SKILLS IN BRICKLAYING AND PLASTERING, ELECTRICAL AUTOMOTIVE MECHANICS AND AQUACULTURE AND LIVESTOCK.

I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS INSTITUTE WILL BRIDGE THE TECHNOLOGY GAP BETWEEN OUR TRAINING INSTITUTIONS AND THE WORLD OF WORK. I AM CERTAIN THAT THE INDUSTRY WILL ALSO FIND THIS FACILITY USEFUL IN SKILLS TRAINING FOR THEIR MEMBERS OF STAFF. 
IN OUR QUEST TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE QUALITY IN SKILLS DEVELOPMENT, WE HAVE ALSO INTRODUCED THE SKILLS DEVELOPMENT FUND THROUGH THE SKILLS LEVY. THIS FUND IS MEANT TO BENEFIT THE TEVET SECTOR THROUGH SKILLS DEVELOPMENT TO WHICH MWENSE TRADES IS ONE OF THE BENEFICIARIES. 
GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO INTRODUCED THE TWO-TIER SYSTEM WHICH PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CHILDREN TO PURSUE BOTH THE ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL PATHS. THIS IS HELPING THE CHILDREN TO BE EQUIPPED FOR LIFE- LONG EMPOWERMENT, WHILE THEY ARE STILL IN SECONDARY SCHOOL. 
I WISH TO, THEREFORE, ENCOURAGE THE ZAMBIAN PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY OUR YOUTH TO LEVERAGE THIS INSTITUTION AND FULLY UTILISE AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITIES AIMED AT ENHANCING YOUR SKILLS. 
LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK ALL STAKEHOLDERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPPING OF THIS FACILITY, AS WELL AS THOSE INVOLVED IN ITS OPERATIONS.

THE SUCCESS AND EFFECTIVE UTILISATION OF MWENSE TRADES INSTITUTE REQUIRES THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL KEY STAKEHOLDERS. THESE INCLUDE GOVERNMENT, THE PRIVATE SECTOR, PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS, INDUSTRY AND EMPLOYERS, COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS, EMPLOYEE ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS TRADE UNIONS. 
I ALSO WISH TO IMPLORE MWENSE RESIDENTS TO ENSURE THAT THIS FACILITY IS WELL LOOKED AFTER. PLEASE GUARD THIS TRAINING INSTITUTE JEALOUSLY, AS IT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED AT A GREAT COST TO GOVERNMENT. 
THE FACILITY IS FOR YOUR OWN BENEFIT AND THE ENTIRE NATION. THEREFORE, LOOK AFTER THE INSTITUTE PROPERLY BY SAFEGUARDING IT FROM VANDALISM. 
WITH MWENSE INSTITUTE, I AM CONFIDENT THAT OUR MANDATE OF FOSTERING NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE PROVISION OF KEY SKILLS TO OUR PEOPLE IS GUARANTEED. 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
IT IS NOW MY SINGULAR HONOUR AND PRIVILEGE TO OFFICIALLY COMMISSION MWENSE TRADES TRAINING INSTITUTE. I THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU ALL.
